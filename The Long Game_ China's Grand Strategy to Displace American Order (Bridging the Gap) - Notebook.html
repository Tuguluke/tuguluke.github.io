    Since 2017, Xi has in many of the country’s critical foreign policy addresses declared that the world is in the midst of “great changes unseen in a century”[百年未有之大变局]. If Li’s line marks the highpoint of China’s humiliation, then Xi’s marks an occasion for its rejuvenation. If Li’s evokes tragedy, then Xi’s evokes opportunity. But both capture something essential: the idea that world order is once again at stake because of unprecedented geopolitical and technological shifts, and that this requires strategic adjustment.

    The most important of these is the Party line(路线), then the guideline(方针), and finally the policy(政策), among other terms. Understanding them sometimes requires proficiency not only in Chinese, but also in seemingly impenetrable and archaic ideological concepts like “dialectical unities” and “historical materialism.”

    A hegemon’s position in regional and global order emerges from three broad “forms of control” that are used to regulate the behavior of other states: coercive capability (to force compliance), consensual inducements (to incentivize it), and legitimacy (to rightfully command it). For rising states, the act of peacefully displacing the hegemon consists of two broad strategies generally pursued in sequence. The first strategy is to blunt the hegemon’s exercise of those forms of control, particularly those extended over the rising state; after all, no rising state can displace the hegemon if it remains at the hegemon’s mercy. The second is to build forms of control over others;

    Beijing feared that multilateral organizations like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (ARF) might be used by Washington to build a liberal regional order or even an Asian NATO, so China joined them to blunt American power. It stalled institutional progress, wielded institutional rules to constrain US freedom of maneuver, and hoped participation would reassure wary neighbors otherwise tempted to join a US-led balancing coalition.

    A better approach—one that keeps “grand strategy” distinctive as a concept—is to view it as an integrated security theory. Security is defined here as “sovereignty [i.e., freedom of maneuver or autonomy], safety, territorial integrity, and power position—the last being the necessary means to the first three.” 4 A grand strategy is a state’s theory of how it can achieve these security-related ends for itself that is intentional, coordinated, and implemented across multiple means of statecraft, such as military, economic, and political instruments.

    Crowe argued that German strategy could “be deduced from her history, from the utterances and known designs of her rulers and statesmen” and from “ascertained facts of German behavior”—that is, texts and behavior. To Crowe’s emphasis on these two factors, we might add one more factor—national security institutions.

    The “stickiness” of a state’s grand strategy comes from both psychological and organizational factors. Research in psychology suggests that “people do not readily alter their beliefs about the world and do not easily confront their own mistakes,” and that “once they are committed to a particular perspective, judgment, or course of action, it is difficult to get them to change their mind.” 9 Organizational research finds that “resource constraints, transaction costs, internal politics, and the domestic environment in which organizations operate,” combined with formal rules and standard-operating-procedures, together help explain “why decision

    In China’s case, the conventional sequence appears to be at work: China initially accommodated a powerful but non-threatening United States after normalization; sought to blunt it after the Cold War’s conclusion led it to see the United States as more threatening; began to build its own order after the Global Financial Crisis led it to see the United States as weakening; and may pursue regional dominance if the United States acquiesces or is defeated in a regional conflict.

    In exploring the Party’s relationship to grand strategy, this chapter undertakes three broad tasks. First, it focuses on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a nationalist party, one that emerged from the patriotic ferment of the late Qing period and has sought to restore the country to its rightful place. Second, it focuses on the CCP as a Leninist party, one that has built centralized institutions—blended with a ruthless amorality—to govern the country and achieve its nationalist mission. Together, the Party’s nationalist orientation helps set the ends of Chinese grand strategy, while Leninism provides an instrument for realizing them. Finally, the book focuses on the CCP as a producer of paper and a subject of research, noting how a careful

    Four decades ago, on the windswept edges of Soviet empire, an improbable partnership was forged. With Beijing’s approval, the United States built and operated two signals intelligence facilities at Korla and Qitai that sat astride old Silk Road caravan routes in western China. These stations were used to monitor Soviet missile testing in Kazakhstan, and within their walls, American intelligence professionals worked shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts in China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to keep tabs on the Soviet threat.

    Under this strategy, China chose not to build the foundations for Asian hegemony because it feared doing so would unsettle the United States and its own neighbors. It avoided major investments in aircraft carriers, ambitious international organizations, and regional economic schemes and instead—as the next three chapters demonstrate—pursued blunting. At the military level, Beijing shifted from a “sea control” strategy increasingly focused on holding distant maritime territory to a “sea denial strategy” focused on blunting the ability of the US military to traverse, control, or intervene in the waters near China. At the political level, Beijing decided to join and then stall regional institutions, blunting Washington’s ability to use them to promote Western ideology or organize an Asian NATO. And at the economic level, unnerved by Tiananmen-era sanctions, Beijing fought to preserve access to American markets, capital, and technology through bilateral and multilateral agreements that blunted the discretionary use of American economic coercion. Together, China’s blunting strategy was remarkable both for its sweep and subtlety across multiple instruments.

To achieve it, however, China would first need to sign an agreement for most-favored nation (MFN) trade status with the United States. 3 At the time, MFN status was restricted by the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which stated that communist or non-market states could only receive MFN if they allowed freedom of emigration, a determination that was subject to a congressional vote each year.

In April 1991, USTR classified China as a “target priority foreign country” and launched a six-month investigation that would trigger sanctions if China was not providing adequate intellectual property (IP) protection. Beijing quickly published new copyright laws, and eventually an agreement was reached after Washington threatened tariffs on $ 700 million of goods—or nearly 5 percent of China’s exports.

    How did the WTO accession process provide China leverage in the MFN negotiation? The answer comes down to its unique particularities. WTO membership requires parties to have unconditional MFN status; if China joined the WTO without securing unconditional MFN status from the United States, the United States would have to invoke the “non-applicability clause,” which would have the effect of ensuring that the WTO rules that the United States and China had agreed to would be “non-applicable” in the bilateral trading relationship.

He declared that China needed to modify Deng’s “hiding capabilities and biding time” by more “Actively Accomplishing Something”[积极有所作为]. 5 This seemingly mundane semantic shift—the addition of the word “actively” to one part of Deng’s doctrine—was momentous. Deng’s guiding doctrine and the larger twenty-four-character phrase in which it was embedded had been consensus for nearly twenty years. Hu had now modified it. That move at such a high-profile forum was a major sign that China was changing its grand strategy. China was no longer interested only in blunting American power. Hu’s invocation of “Actively Accomplishing Something,” and Xi’s spin on the concept with “Striving for Achievement”[奋发有为], indicated a shift to building regional order within Asia.

For example, it refused to approve the ADB’s multilateral development plan for India because some funds would be used in Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims. 75 AIIB also offers opportunities for giving others important roles within Chinese order. Already, the decisions regarding which countries hold AIIB vice presidencies is assumed to be linked to China’s political interests. South Korea was promised one of AIIB’s vice presidencies because of its early support for AIIB, but it lost that slot to France in a decision linked to Seoul’s deployment of US missile defense systems.” 76 China privately offered Australia a senior role in AIIB if it signed the October 2014 MOU, but then retracted that offer when Australia’s hesitance was perceived as flowing from US and Japanese pressure.

    Wang had encouraged a rising China to march westward to avoid a hostile east. But about a century earlier, a rising Germany had decided to march eastward to avoid a hostile west. Germany’s leadership had sought to construct a 1,000-mile railway from Berlin all the way to Baghdad and onward to the Persian Gulf. For Germany, this “Berlin-Baghdad railway” would not only bypass the preeminent British navy, it would also spread German influence deeper into the Middle East, open up the Ottoman Empire as an export market and source for raw materials, and offer Germany a way to protect its overseas possessions in Africa. Germany’s grand infrastructure ambitions then were hardly unique: Britain had built the Suez Canal, the United States had built the Panama Canal, and the Japanese had hoped to build their own canal across Thailand’s “Isthmus of Kra” to bypass British control over Singapore and the Malacca Strait. All understood that geography could reshape geopolitics.

    Infrastructure investment not only facilitates trade and connectivity, it also offers the opportunity to practice “economic power projection”—and through it, an opportunity to reshape the strategic geography of great power competition. Like past great powers, Beijing has used infrastructure investment as a tool to build order, and the most visible example of this pursuit is China’s BRI as well as the financial institutions that support it.

<div class="noteText">
    First, some believe that the BRI is primarily driven by China’s pursuit of absolute economic benefits. Most of the projects, however, are loss-making, which raises some doubts about this explanation. For example, an analysis shows BRI’s port projects, which constitute an “easy case” for evaluating profitability since maritime trade dramatically exceeds overland trade, are generally struggling. An analysis of their finances by the think tank C4ADS finds that “several marked examples of unprofitability—suggest that Beijing is actively seeking to leverage the geopolitical capacity of its port projects.” 34 For example, China’s $ 8 billion investment in a Malaysian port near the Malacca Strait is evaluated as completely redundant by the World Bank given that nearby existing ports remain under capacity. China’s Hambanatota port in Sri Lanka has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since it opened and has virtually no real cargo traffic (its traffic is one-hundredth the amount of its neighboring port in Columbo), but China has nonetheless assumed the liabilities and taken a ninety-nine-year lease of the port. 35 China’s construction of the Gwadar port in Pakistan is similarly unprofitable but sees continued Chinese investment, and China has undertaken a forty-year lease and assumed its liabilities as well. There is no economic rationale for these investments, but as we will see, there is evidence of strategic motivations. Second, some account for the poor finances of the projects by suggesting that they may be serve the interests of powerful vested interest groups. In particular, BRI is seen as a way to support China’s domestic economy by creating opportunities for its connected industries to be involved in infrastructure projects overseas. This explanation also has problems. As David Dollar notes, BRI will struggle to absorb China’s surplus capacity even under the most optimistic circumstances. “In steel alone,” he notes, “China would need $ 60 billion per year of extra demand to absorb excess capacity. This figure excludes excess capacity in cement, construction, and heavy machinery.” He concludes that BRI and the projects it supports are “much too small to make any dent in China’s excess capacity problem—even if it were the sole supplier for these projects, which it won’t be." 36

    Moreover, a growing percentage of China’s loans will not be paid back. This has already been the case in Sri Lanka and may well prove the case in countries like the Maldives, where roughly 20 percent of the budget is spent on servicing Chinese debt. Lending capital at a loss makes no economic sense, but if the result is a strategic asset, it does make strategic sense. Third, some argue that the BRI is neither economic nor strategic but motivated in large part by status—they see it as a vanity project for Xi Jinping. But the timeline does not support this account. Many of the major projects (e.g., Gwadar, Hambanatota, and several rail and gas projects across Central Asia) not only preceded Xi and his BRI but were also explicitly described in strategic terms in Chinese government discourses, as we will see. Fourth, a number of critics argue that BRI is largely meaningless. They argue that if everything China does is now folded by the government under BRI—from a Polar Silk Road to vaguely conceived BRI space roads—then the term means nothing. This criticism is entirely warranted, but even if the brand is at times empty many of the projects are quite real. A narrow focus on the BRI brand alone obscures the way infrastructure both within and outside the program creates enduring economic leverage. If BRI is taken to mean those key projects in the Indo-Pacific that China has pursued for years—which were of course the original focus of the initiative—then there is little question that many of the marquee projects are motivated by strategic designs.

    In the case of the Maldives, as discussed earlier, some 20 percent of the country’s budget now pays off interest on Chinese loans. In Sri Lanka, annual loan repayments—most of which are to China—now equal nearly the entirety of Sri Lanka’s government revenue. 37 Interest rates are also exorbitant, running nearly 6 percent for Hambanatota expansion versus roughly half a percent for Japanese infrastructure loans.

    Perhaps the best explanation for China’s investment in SWIFT alternatives is that it provides reduced vulnerability to US financial power. Although SWIFT is a messaging service and does not engage in clearing and settling, if a bank is cut off from the network, it is essentially cut off from the global financial system and from much of the clearing and settling infrastructure that exists. In this way, control over SWIFT offers considerable structural power.

    The People’s Bank of China—with approval from the Chinese government—began developing its own alternative to SWIFT for financial messaging and interbank payments as early as 2013, roughly one year after the West cut off Iran. 86 This system, known as the China International Payments System (CIPS), would not only insulate China from financial pressure but also increase its own autonomy, giving it sovereign control over all information that passes through its network, the power to help others bypass sanctions, and the ability to one day cut others off from China’s system. Moreover, the ambition for CIPS exceeds that for SWIFT: the former would not only be a messaging service like SWIFT but will also provide clearance and settlement—that is, full integration of the payments process.

    The “key” to stealing the march on these new waves of industrial revolution was a country’s “institutional advantages,” the Study Times commentary noted. “Britain replaced Spanish hegemony because the capitalist system was far superior to the feudal system that bound farmers to the land. The great changes a hundred years ago stemmed from the establishment of a more thorough democratic republican system in the United States, which created a modern market system and a standardized large industrial production system [e.g., assembly lines] that were significantly different from the United Kingdom.”

Accommodationist perspectives can be grouped into a few broad categories: (1) full unilateral territorial accommodation; (2) a “maximalist” grand bargain; (3) a much more careful, “minimalist” grand bargain that phases in mutual accommodation; and (4) tactical or operational reassurance at the political and military level.

    A series of policy prescriptions fall into the broad category of seeking to change China, that is, removing or softening the internal structures that supposedly make China a competitor. Efforts that sought to “peacefully evolve” China in a more liberal direction or support supposedly liberal factions have not been successful and are now especially unlikely to succeed; conversely, efforts to subvert or overthrow the Party discount its strength and the challenges of engineering China’s politics.

    Western observers often have a poor record of identifying potential allies. Western journalists like Nicholas Kristof argued: “The new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize–winning writer, will be released from prison.” 38 Every one of these predictions proved incorrect. Writing in 2014, Lyle Goldstein claimed that Xi was not particularly illiberal or even nationalist: “Rather, Xi is an engineer whose family suffered terribly during the mass hysteria and radicalism of the Cultural Revolution. He has few connections with the military, and he lived briefly in Iowa. Betraying his rather liberal and even pro-Western worldview, he has sent his only child to be educated at Harvard.” 39 This too has been proven incorrect. Supposed liberal reformers like Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, and Wang Qishan, among others, have likewise been unable or unwilling to advocate the reformist political cause. In the present, it is highly unlikely reformers exist at the highest levels or would be able to seriously shape Xi Jinping’s choices.

    Efforts to subvert China’s government are particularly dangerous and unlikely to succeed. First, efforts to overthrow the CCP would produce all-out confrontation that could transform the competition from one that is over order to one that is fundamentally existential. It is likely that this effort would dramatically increase the risk of war, eliminate almost any prospect for cooperation on shared threats like climate change, and likely invite significant reciprocal Chinese interference in American electoral politics.

    China is not ripe for a bottom-up color revolution, and the prospects for one have declined as the government’s digital authoritarianism has reduced the cost for the state to monitor or punish dissidents. Political polling is extremely complicated in China, but there is some social science evidence showing a lack of widespread discontent with the Party’s leadership. 40 Moreover, the government’s effort to paint itself as a superior model to the West within China has likely succeeded, particularly post-COVID-19. China is likely not as sclerotic and incompetent as the Soviet Union, and the United States is not as attractive within China as it was in the 1980s and 1990s.

    Elites are likely less satisfied with Xi than the public, but China is not ripe for an elite revolt either.

As she argued, “The advanced surveillance technology is not only utilized in monitoring Xinjiang and Tibet, but it is also applied to monitor CCP members as well as mid-and high-level officials,” and “normal socialization” among Party cadres is often prohibited.

    Both the United States and China have various advantages in mobilizing resources for strategic competition. China’s system affords it significant influence over the economy through state-owned enterprises and the penetration of major private companies that in reality often act as national champions. In contrast, the United States has far less control over its economic base and resources, and its public debt levels are already high—now exceeding the size of the entire US economy for the first time since World War II due to the 2020 pandemic. While interest payments remain relatively low because of the dollar’s status and the desire for safe assets, they could eventually rise. And when those payments are combined with mandatory non-discretionary spending, a large and growing share of GDP that is difficult to adjust through public policy, the fiscal space for strategic competition shrinks further. It is true that China faces disadvantages—a demographic slowdown, the middle-income trap, high levels of public debt, a problematic financial system—and that the openness of the US system buttresses the dollar’s dominance and enables Washington to raise significant resources in debt markets. But overall, while the United States remains a large, young, and growing country, it is still a smaller one than China, and one that faces democratic limits on resource mobilization for long-term competition as well as significant fiscal headwinds. No US strategy that ignores these realities will be sustainable, and therefore the starting point for any strategy must

    be asymmetric. What might be the strengths the United States could leverage? American democracy—and the order it has produced—provide competitive strengths relative to its authoritarian competitor. Conventional wisdom sees authoritarian states as unconstrained by institutional checks or public opinion and therefore able to act covertly, decisively, and ruthlessly, often mobilizing enormous resources and charting long-term strategies. But that provides risks as well. Autocracies can move rapidly in the right direction or equally rapidly in a disastrous one, all without the mediating effect of public debate and consent. In contrast, American openness and rule of law produce more constant advantages. They offer allies and even adversaries voice opportunities within the order, broadcast American intentions and ambitions, and are often combined with global goods provision—thereby making US hegemony less threatening and more acceptable. Critically, these advantages also ensure that the country can attract the allies, immigrants, and capital that underpin liberal order, technological innovation, military power, and dollar dominance. These are the foundations of American order, and they provide a unique advantage relative to China. Building and rebuilding them must remain a priority.
