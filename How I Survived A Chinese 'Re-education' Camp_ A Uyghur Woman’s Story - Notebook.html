<div class="noteText">
    Herein lies the hypocrisy and perversity of the Chinese concentration camp system, which seeks not to punish an extremist Uyghur minority, but instead to eradicate an entire ethnicity, right down to those of its members living in exile abroad, like Gulbahar.

    ‘Absurd, right?’ We’d all laugh. By making fun of herself and those she’d met, she was exposing the madness of the concentration camp system. When recounting the confessions she’d made under police duress, Gulbahar was overcome by an uncontrollable fit of hysterical laughter. In fact, mockery and its attendant laughter often freed her from her trauma.

<div class="noteText">
    How much humiliation, inequality, injustice does it take before someone rises up and cries, ‘Enough!’? According to a Chinese proverb, anything can happen to anyone at any time. In Xinjiang, checkpoints, police inspections, interrogations, intimidation, and threats were so common we barely paid them any mind. So it was that we lived on borrowed time, in a state of partial freedom that could be snatched away from us at any moment.

    Speaking Uyghur is forbidden. Praying is forbidden. Fighting is forbidden. Hunger strikes are forbidden. If you are sick and require medical attention, refusing medical care is forbidden. Breaking the rules is forbidden. Drawing on the walls is forbidden. Poor hygiene is forbidden. Among the rights, I made out the ‘right to free worship’ and the ‘right to counsel.’ This was my first act of resistance. Learning everything by heart. Not giving them the chance or the pleasure of humiliating me with punishment.

    And yet here we were, incarcerated. We who were guilty of nothing and yet guilty all the same. Such was the art of repression according to the Chinese Communist Party: banning everything while also allowing it. Reforming you while singing your praises. Imprisoning you while educating you. Not a single one of our friends in Karamay could assert with conviction that he’d been discriminated against since he was born. ‘True, they’ve become mean,’ whispered one friend at a dinner as I recounted my passport difficulties that January with embarrassment. Another said: ‘It’s getting harder and harder to find a job. Kerim was right.’ But as always, discrimination dissolved in illusions of freedom: the folklore of music and dance that provincial administrators gave pride of place in official ceremonies, or compliments from Han people celebrating the beauty of Uyghur women.

    It seemed like the premises of a factory, but I didn’t yet have a handle on just how big it was. In Baijiantan, daily life came down to a triangular ambit: cell –classroom –mess hall. Only the sheer number of prisoners and guards whose paths we crossed when being herded around in a group gave me an inkling of just how enormous the camp really was. Every day, I saw new faces, zombie-like, bags under the eyes. So far, I had never seen the same group of prisoners twice.

    The classroom, the bathroom, the mess hall, the cell: there was nowhere in Baijiantan where we were not subject to violence or coercion from the teachers, police officers, and guards. Even when they weren’t on our backs, the cameras were still watching us. We were reduced to living like disposable creatures, eternal victims bowed under the weight of threats.

    Whether they locked us up or not, China reserved one fate and one fate alone for us all: ‘re-education’ through fear, coercion, and censorship. Without distinction, they ground us all underfoot in the open-air prison that Xinjiang had become.

    Lying on my straw mattress at night, my body still tense from the day’s stresses, I would fall into a restless sleep filled with proctors, uniformed men, fellow detainees, and Chinese flags. I could even hear one of my cellmates humming one of the choruses drummed into our heads that day.

    Plenty of things that we had once found shocking were now the norm. Slaps, insults, fellow prisoners getting heart attacks or just vanishing: all that was daily life here. The arduous pace of life in detention –with its succession of classes and meals that were just as hard to swallow –was so exhausting that I couldn’t even think anymore. The teachers gave us each a diary. In the rare moments of ‘free time’ at our disposal, we were to write down our thoughts: our dreams, our memories, our ‘sins.’ Every three days, guards would collect these notebooks. Our teachers would read them over, worming their way into the troubled intimacy of our hearts. Did they really think I’d divulge the slightest truth in those pages? Writing gave me no solace because all those pages written in the pallid light were just lies. A smokescreen to fool my teachers and their destructive ‘re-education.’ Inside, I laughed at those idiotic sentences. But deep down, I knew that the constant self-criticism I’d been reduced to was, with every passing day, moving me farther away from the Gulbahar I’d once been.

    During our free time, many women confessed to me, ashamed, that they were no longer having their periods. They reported that their menstrual flow had stopped shortly after the ‘vaccinations.’ The younger women, most of whom were engaged to be wed, wept and grieved. They had hoped to start families once they were released from camp. Past the menopause myself, I tried to comfort them, though a horrific thought was already growing inside me: were they sterilising us?

    In the year that followed, I wasted away between the frozen walls of my cell, which filled with distraught women whose names had been replaced with numbers, whom I no longer had the strength to get to know. In the maze of the camp, cut off from the rest of the world, my perseverance crumbled away. The exhausting routine repeated itself infinitely, becoming one all-encompassing, gruelling day. Every day we submitted ourselves to the guards’ whistles, shouts, and insults. In the foul-smelling corridors, our ghostly shadows trudged to the bathroom, then slogged to the classroom where we choked down the teachers’ lies until evening fell. Sometimes, the screams of some women at night still woke others with a start. When these distant voices pierced the darkness, frigid figures sat up from their beds, then sank feebly back down into the dark. I opened an eye but no longer gave any thought to where the screams were coming from, or what tortures were being put to those victims. I fell back asleep.

    The relentless clockwork of brainwashing finally penetrated even the boldest and most impervious among us. ‘Chen Quanguo is really underestimating us. He’ll never change us, not like this,’ one of my cellmates whispered one night. In the dark, her middle finger to Xinjiang’s top official made me smile. I wanted to believe the Party hadn’t won, but hadn’t the ‘re-education’ already worked?

    From now on, the people of Xinjiang were no longer citizens, but suspects. The massive stockpiling of DNA, carefully organised in the digital labyrinth where the police stored their files, confirmed a terrible theory: all citizens of the province, so long as they were Uyghur, represented a potential terrorist threat.

    But European democracies do not have the same stake in the game. They squirm, uneasy, for any such match seems stacked against them, not to say a foregone loss. First of all, because China excels in the domain of economic diplomacy: the money it lavishes, notably on European countries, buys indulgence and forces government concessions.

    In addition, China is worming its way into gaps offered by the United Nations. In 2018, as the transformation of Xinjiang was steadily progressing, Beijing was scheming with the UN’s subsidiary agencies to place its pawns in strategic positions. Its agents wielded lobbying and threats to achieve their ends, slowly specifying, little by little, new rules for the international game where human rights would be sidelined in favour of a country’s social and economic development. China’s voice already carried far more weight than its right of veto, again due to the money it injected into different levels of the UN.

    The first was Adrian Zenz. The second, Shawn Zhang. These two men had one thing in common. In the spring of 2018, during the media outpouring of horrific although unverifiable accounts from Uyghur families whose loved ones had disappeared, as well as from a few rare survivors of the Chinese ‘schools,’ these two men brought governments and international organisations what was missing: evidence. Mountains of evidence.

    If the world had still been in doubt, here was confirmation: China, despite all its claims, was not done with labour camps. Up until 2013, when it declared that it had abolished all such repressive methods from its penal system, China possessed a robust network of detention centres where it sent political and religious dissidents, criminals, and fringe elements of society without making much of a distinction. Established by Mao Zedong in 1957, the laogai (literally, ‘reform through labour’) were to the Middle Kingdom what the gulag had been to Russia: a gargantuan archipelago scattered throughout the land, where detainees exhausted themselves trying to redeem their ‘crimes’ by the sweat of their brow. A particularity of China’s sprawling penal system was the independent category of laojiao, or ‘re-education through labour,’ which unlike the laogai were not subject to the rules governing judiciary procedures in China. In other words, anyone could be sent to a laojiao for up to four years without a trial if their thoughts were deemed inappropriate. Supposedly abolished along with the laogai in 2013, these institutions were aimed at rehabilitating those the Party saw as having spiritual influences.

    None of this remotely resembled a trial. A trial has a courtroom that looks like a courtroom, not some interrogation room in a police station; a judge that looks like a judge, not someone in a military uniform like the pudgy little man before me. Real, actual people sit on the benches, people closely or distantly related to the accused: family, friends, colleagues. They are called to the stand to bear witness. Here, the black plastic benches were empty, and there was no witness stand.

    No, this trial wasn’t a trial at all, of course, but everyone acted like it was: the soldier-judge, his flunkies to his right and left (policemen in uniform), the tutoresses who should have leapt at the chance to play lawyer, raising an eyebrow when the judge spoke, replying to their clients’ worried gazes with a polite smile. And we four, the accused, trapped in a Kafkaesque, illegal judicial system where there was no such thing as justice and no way that we were going to be judged for what we had done, but rather automatically condemned for who we were: Uyghurs.

    We were in the building for those who had been tried. Their eyes filled with concerned curiosity, the girls asked me silent questions. I could read their lips. ‘How many years? How many years did they give you?’ I held up seven fingers. ‘Seven years?’ Yes, seven. The girls found that ‘heavy.’ I insisted with my hands. We laughed. In such terrible moments, you don’t know what to think or feel. So laughter comes bubbling up like a breath of fresh air.

    To further illustrate what had befallen me, Gulhumar invoked the stories of two survivors, both refugees now, one in the U.S. and one in Turkey. Their accounts beggar belief: nights spent keeping watching in turns over cells they shared with 40 other women. The tasteless food, the mysterious medication that plunged inmates into a state of torpor where memories frayed and time disappeared, along with menstrual cycles. Electric shocks administered through special helmets.

    for months now, they had been receiving numerous text messages and calls from unlisted numbers based in China. These messages were coming from police stations in Xinjiang, dictated by intelligence services and typed by officials tasked with keeping tabs on and track of Uyghurs who’d fled abroad.’ They sought to repatriate these ‘traitors’; the same fate that had befallen me awaited them. Requests for documentation came flooding in, each finickier and more oppressive than the last, from copies of leases to proof of enrolment in classes to diplomas. So did summonses, for when a student took the bait, the unnamed agent on the other end grew dogged.

    For a few months, the Embassy had been secretly hatching a new scheme meant to make the most defiant Uyghurs abroad give in. Those who applied to have their passports renewed would be categorically turned down, with no reason given. ‘You’re from Xinjiang. We cannot renew your passport. You must return home to start the application process. That’s the new policy,’ they were told at the service window in Paris. Without a passport, there was no way to secure the precious residence permit that allowed them to pursue their studies in France. A Sword of Damocles was dangling over their heads. By dooming them to be undocumented, the Embassy was forcing them to return to Xinjiang. Again, this fooled no one: it was obvious that once there, they would be locked up in camps.

    Iwas going to spend the next seven years here. Not that I’d given into the idea, but I had no choice but to surrender to the life that was resuming its usual course. A string of identical days paraded by, without morning or night, sadness or hope. There was no such thing as Monday, or Tuesday or Friday; no lunch or dinner; no lessons any different from the ones that had come before. There were only days devoid of meaning, where the echo of my fellow detainees chewing in the mess hall gave way to the warders’ shouts, which in turn gave way to the teachers’ litanies of propaganda.

The pain had to be unimaginable. It had to stop. ‘Stop! Stop!’ she cried out to the men who stared back at her, unblinking. That was when she recognised the voice. It was Dolkun, her son. They were torturing her son, and on the table before her, the confession awaited her signature. Zahida signed, trembling. She did as she was told, and gradually, the screams stopped. Then she was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Since then, she’d been in jail, waiting for her transfer. That had been two years ago. She never found out what had happened to Dolkun: if he’d died in the room next door, or if he’d been sentenced and sent to prison, too.

    The interrogations were like a game of chess. Both players –policeman on one side, detainee on the other –had their pawns, their bishops, their rooks, their queen, and their king. One player’s pieces advanced across the board according to a strategy that was always changing in response to the other player’s moves. Admittedly, the policeman always came in with an upper hand that would allow him to win the game, or so he thought. But as the interrogations piled up, prisoners on the far side of the table became better able to anticipate their opponent’s moves. They learned the tricks, the secrets, dodging traps the other had laid. I’m not saying that I excelled at this game, but I had picked up techniques from policemen trying to get you to talk by provoking a combination of anger, fear, and despair. They’d show you a photo, the face of a loved one, or else a series of text messages to throw you off-balance. You had to remain utterly in control of your emotions. The slightest shudder was like cracking open a door that they’d kick in with their boots. A veteran now of several hundreds of hours of questioning, during which I’d racked up major defeats and then, over time, small victories, I wasn’t too worried when the police had summoned me a week earlier.

This is their nourishment in the long months after every interrogation, since they’ve been told they’ll be freed if they’re patient. So they show how patient they can be. They grit their teeth a little harder. But getting summoned two days in a row? I assure you, it never happens.

    The women in jail had told me about police techniques for filming your confession. Once they had it on tape, they could dangle your own words over your head at any time, as blackmail. To make you cooperate with the police or, on the contrary, to keep you quiet about the abuses you’d suffered. If you spoke up, the video would be spread online, and people would see you, all dolled up and decked out, talking about how you’d slandered the Party then asked its forgiveness. That way, no one would believe you when you protested your innocence. The Party would always have a hold over those it was monitoring.

I’d imagined the intense joy that would flood my being, and yet now, when I was being told that I’d be rejoining the world of the living at last, I felt empty, drained, stripped of the slightest human emotion. My mind was dark, not a single ray of light filtering in. An opaque mass of lessons, interrogations, abuse, bumping up against one another. They formed a shapeless pile of painful memories I couldn’t look away from. That man had broken my body, my soul, and though the thought of seeing those I’d betrayed in my weakness terrified me, that arrogant man, one of the hundreds responsible for my suffering, had the gall to declare I was free! At that moment, I was overcome by a strange combination of pride, weariness, and fear. I was free. Or so I thought.

    How even to begin such a tale? How to tell them that I lived at the mercy of police violence, of Uyghurs like me who, because of the status their uniforms gave them, could do as they wished with our bodies and souls? Of men and women whose brains had been thoroughly washed, robots stripped of humanity zealously enforcing orders. Petty bureaucrats alienated by the hierarchy of a sprawling system in which those who do not denounce others are themselves denounced. Those who do not punish others are themselves punished. Persuaded we were enemies to be beaten down, traitors and terrorists, they took away our freedom. They locked us up like animals away from the rest of the world, away from time –in camps. There, those men and women brainwashed us. They propagated bad ideas, false ideas. They wanted to ‘reeducate’ us. They taught us to march in time to the national anthem in windowless classrooms where women collapsed from lack of oxygen only to be taken by guards even deeper into the bowels of a concentration camp system. In the ‘transformation-through-education’ camps, life and death do not mean the same thing they do elsewhere. When the footfalls of guards woke us in the night, I thought a hundred times over that our time had come to be executed. When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull, and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders, I shut my eyes, clouded with tears, thinking my end was near, that I was being readied for the scaffold, the electric chair, or drowning. Death lurked in every corner. When the nurses grabbed my arm to ‘vaccinate’ me, I thought they were poisoning me. Actually, they were sterilising us. That was when I understood the method of the camps, the strategy being implemented: not to kill us in cold blood, but to make us slowly disappear. So slowly that no one would notice. We were ordered to deny who we were. To spit on our own traditions, our beliefs. To criticise our language. To insult our own people. I was made to believe that we, the Haitiwajis, were terrorists. I was so far away, so alone, so exhausted and alienated, that I almost ended up believing it.

    Before stuffing our heads with lessons, grotesque military parades, and nights spent on a bed of wood or cement, the first thing they did in detention was to take away our personalities. When we put on that filthy jumpsuit and black cloth slippers, each prisoner became just like all the others. From that moment on, we were referred to not by our names but by numbers. Our souls withered away. In ‘re-education’ camp and prison alike, submission abolished our wants, our passions. We were forbidden from speaking or writing things, which once made us unique, just as we were from marking our personal effects or our food: we slept on the same beds, we swallowed the same vile food. Through a series of punctures, the system drained us of who we were. Then, after emptying our minds, teachers crammed them with propaganda’s dark ideas. We repeated the same phrases glorifying the Party. By filling ourselves with this pap, we were ‘re-educating’ ourselves just as diligently. We lost our identity. Our selves crumbled away, all at the same pace, and when it was over we resembled each other physically and emotionally: misshapen phantoms, passive, unfeeling, and empty. We weren’t people anymore then. We might as well have been dead.

    In Xinjiang, where draconian surveillance orchestrates people’s lives, each street has its own ‘neighbourhood committee.’ From these offices, often on the ground floor of an apartment tower, volunteers and civil servants guide citizens’ administrative initiatives. They themselves are locals, which makes them a sympathetic ear to talk to candidly about health, retirement, or education. In reality, these people must report on all neighbourhood events to the police. The neighbourhood committees record the name, age, and profession of each resident in each apartment. This information is stored in a file updated with details of their travel and visitors. That is why police officers often come knocking unannounced to offer you their services and at the same time to see if everyone you’re living with is reflected in their files. Every resident must fill out a declaration for anyone they’re hosting. According to the ‘3-6-9’ rule, citizens have three hours to declare their visitors to the neighbourhood committee, which in turn has six hours to notify the local precinct, which must register that visitor’s contact info in their files within nine hours. There are no exceptions. Everyone followed the ‘3-6-9’ rule.

    That was when she realised something was wrong. That was when she realised, distraught, that China had won. The repression in Xinjiang made itself felt in the small community of Uyghurs in France, to such an extent that the outpouring of warmth from her friends was not as great as she’d hoped. Gulbahar was welcomed back only tepidly, even coldly. On their worried faces, in the text messages they left answered, she saw something like discomfort, a barely perceptible fear. ‘It’s not that I don’t want to see you, you know. But I feel uneasy. Your apartment must be bugged,’ a very close friend finally confessed. Rumours about the Haitiwajis abounded: how was it that Gulbahar had been freed? No one ever got out of those camps. Had she made a deal with the police? Had she named names? No matter which way you cut it, there was something odd about her release. She must have collaborated with them. That was what people were saying. In the empty moments of embarrassed silence, she realised that she was no longer seen as a victim, but rather a spy. A traitor in the fold, among her own kind. The situation in China did her no favours: the more they steamrollered over everything there, the more paranoid the people of the diaspora became.
