    I was too young then to understand that the performance of “ethnic dance” and the cultural hierarchy inherent in that framing had a long history in China. As early as the 1940s, dance troupes from the Uyghur homeland were being sent into China to entertain Han audiences. This only played into the sense of the Uyghur as being a “simple” and “backward” people, able to sing and dance, but unable to rule themselves.

    But we did learn that he’d been arrested along with four other students at the Medical College. They were accused of breaking into the Ürümchi police chief’s house, a prominent Uyghur in the community, and stealing thirty kilograms of gold from his cupboard. No one asked what the police chief was doing with thirty kilos of gold in his kitchen.

    My brother was tortured for three days in the police station. He was hung by his arms from chains and beaten. When he refused to confess or name any accomplices, they just beat him harder. Suspects aren’t treated well anywhere in China—if you’re arrested, you’re considered guilty unless proven innocent—but the fact that Kaisar was Uyghur meant that he was subject to the worst treatment. The police had no fear of any repercussions for brutality or neglect; they had the full force of the CCP behind them. They knew it, and we knew it too.

    Two or three years before, I had never even heard of heroin. Now it seemed to be everywhere. Drugs, heroin in particular, had infiltrated the Uyghur community seemingly overnight, coming in via recently loosened borders with neighboring countries like Afghanistan. The CCP was encouraging trade, but along with legitimate goods came opiates. No one really knew what these drugs were, and no one had any idea how much damage they could cause to individuals and entire communities. Because of the endemic unemployment in the Uyghur community, a lot of young people, men in particular, were sucked into a cycle of addiction. Alcohol abuse was also on the rise, despite the Islamic prohibitions against it. But at least that was a known evil. As addiction spread through the community, some Han began to view Uyghurs as likely drug dealers, a stereotype that spread through China and fed fuel to the idea that Uyghurs were criminals and a dangerous element.

    This was in keeping with the way the CCP had begun to deal with the Uyghur region. Young Uyghur men in particular were explicitly viewed as criminals or criminals in the making, and crimes were punished as harshly as possible. Seemingly every chance to intimidate the Uyghur population was viewed as a victory; fear had begun to be employed as a potent weapon to prevent people from organizing, speaking freely, or trying to promote Uyghur culture.

    By this point, in the run-up to the early 2000s, things were already looking dark, and then an official policy of so-called bilingual education was implemented across the Uyghur region. According to the official propaganda, it was a simple initiative to increase the Uyghur population’s knowledge of Chinese. But in fact, it was a new major step toward the annihilation of Uyghur culture and the inculcation of Uyghurs with Han traditions, atheist attitudes and morals, and Chinese social mores. Educators, from elementary school teachers to university professors, had to change their language of instruction to Chinese. Even courses in Uyghur literature and the history of the Uyghur region, limited and biased as they were, had to be taught in Chinese. Uyghur textbooks were systematically destroyed and replaced by Chinese textbooks, and teachers were required to undergo a rigorous reeducation. When the legislation was enacted, it felt like the sudden blow of an axe. But the axe had been hanging over us for a decade.

    Instead, I had to parrot the CCP party line, telling Uyghur children that the Chinese Communist Party loves them like a father and that they must love it back. I had to teach them to be ashamed of their own language and to reject their own ancient music and books and stories. That Uyghur culture was backward; Chinese culture was the future. Every day when I went to work, I was being untruthful, not only to my viewers but also to myself. I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror anymore.

    Suddenly, anyone who supported Uyghur independence or the recognition of East Turkestan was no longer just a “splittist” but now also a “terrorist.” The change in nomenclature was significant. It meant that the CCP could harass and arrest Muslims while claiming to be merely protecting Chinese national security against outside jihadist influences, even though there was scant evidence of any significant presence of religious extremists in the Uyghur region.

    Uyghur family members rarely say I love you. We cook for each other, give gifts, hug and kiss. At home, I’d never once said I love you to my dad. But, lying there, I realized that now, apart from everyone, the only way I had to show my love was through my words.

    Uyghurs were frequently offered substandard medical care, treated like disposable bodies.

    had begun to uncover a system of reeducation that had been building slowly for years. I had heard of people being sent for fifteen days or a month to “Party schools,” centers staffed by CCP members meant to teach people Marxism and inculcate them with a love for the Chinese Communist Party. These schools taught that any religious belief was superstition and only CCP ideology represented truth. People were held there for minor infractions—going to the mosque, refusing to sing the Chinese anthem, dressing “too modestly,” refusing alcohol—and forced to recite communist propaganda, swear their loyalty to the Communist Party, and promise not to engage in “religious extremism.”

A fully two-tiered society had been imposed, one tier facing a technologically advanced surveillance state.

    My work at RFA helps with that feeling, at least. I can connect with my people, feel the same happiness and pain and hope. I feel like I’m part of the Uyghur experience, even though I’m not there. Since China began to pursue a policy of genocide against the Uyghurs, we have had to unite more completely. Our common suffering and persecutions have made us understand that we are one nation, united by a common ancestry and a common destiny.

    The Chinese Communist Party is taking hostages by the millions, not only inflicting pain directly on those it puts into its concentration camps, but even delivering illegal threats individually to relatives abroad. The world’s silence has only encouraged China to expand its concentration camps to hold millions of people. And those outside the camps suffer under the world’s worst Orwellian mass surveillance police state.
