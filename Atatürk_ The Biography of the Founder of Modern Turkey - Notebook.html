    But his aim was not imitation but participation in a universal civilization, which, like the thinkers of the European Enlightenment, he saw as the onward march of humanity, regardless of religion and the divisions it caused. He believed that the struggle for genuine independence should be waged by each nation for itself in the name of an overarching secular ideal of progress common to all, and therefore leaving no room for antagonism towards the most advanced nations. He was an anti-imperialist only in the sense that his ideal was a universal commonwealth of civilized people. Above all, he was a builder, the greatest nation-builder of modern times.

    However, while the application of reason to the mastery of the material world produced undeniable benefits, in the realm of human affairs its results were mixed. True, the exercise of reason could improve on traditional social and political arrangements. But the pursuit of rationalist policies, ideologies and theories created new differences and new tensions within and between existing communities. At the same time, old divisions survived under new names. Where traditional Christian believers fought infidels, enlightened rationalists of Christian antecedents believed they were at grips with ignorant fanatics. Thus, Muslims had been infidels because they controverted Christianity. Now they were fanatics because they resisted rational enlightenment. Religious missionaries sought to convert infidels to the true faith. Similarly, enlightened European thinkers, teachers and rulers attempted to make fanatics see reason and mend their ways.

    Rationalists reinforced another old division when they subdivided races into nations. The success of European peoples, united domestically and distinguished from their neighbours by language and historical antecedents, and consequently thinking of themselves as distinct nations, led to the belief that nations were the natural units of political organization.

    But while one can follow the concatenation of ideas which led from universal human rights, posited by reason, to the ideology of nationalism and the consequent belief that it was best for state and nation to coincide, it remains nevertheless true that nationalism and the brotherhood of man were not obviously compatible, even in theory. In practice, the ideology of nationalism, which flowed out of the French. Revolution, split up existing states and communities. It produced much suffering and millions of victims, caused material losses and impoverished the lives even of winners in nationalist contests for territory and power. The fate of losers was much sadder.

    Liberty, equality and fraternity were not logically incompatible with the existence of multinational empires, even if in practice they subverted the hierarchies on which these empires rested. But nationalism, which spread together with the ideals of the French Revolution, destroyed them. It added a new animus to old communal, religious, sectarian and tribal differences, endowing them with a rational explanation. Both ideology and observation found rational justification for aggression. National communities had mastered the new rational European civilization in unequal measure. Observably, this inequality was reflected in their performance, both domestically and in contest with other communities. This led to the conclusion that, like races, national communities were not only actually, but inherently, unequal in their aptitude for civilization and their propensity to unreasonable fanaticism. Nations, like individuals, could therefore be divided not only into advanced and backward, learned and ignorant, but into deserving and undeserving, rich and poor. It was not a dispensation with which the losers could agree. But they could only prove that they did not deserve their lot by gaining strength through the acquisition of the universal European civilization. Civilization was the prerequisite of success. Conversely, success in a national contest was proof of civilization.

    them in new ways. Where medieval Arab geographers wrote that Slavs and other northerners were irascible, because red bile predominated in their temperament, rationalists dispensed with the theory of humours in favour of that of civilization. Vicomte de la Jonquière declared in 1881: ‘The Ottoman people is not more recalcitrant to civilization than any other nation. It has native qualities for which one would look in vain in the other races of the empire: it is honest and decent. The ignorance in which it is plunged, the fanaticism of which it provides so much bloody evidence –all this should be attributed to those who are in charge of its destiny.’

    The Ottomans were prompt to use European military technology. But outside the military sphere, the penetration of European ideas and practices was slow. It was not until 1727 that a Hungarian from Transylvania, who had converted from Unitarianism to Islam, was able to set up in Istanbul a first printing press using Arabic characters. It was closed down after a few years, and printing had to be reintroduced later.

    Among Jews, there was an important wave of conversion to Islam after the failure of the Messianic movement led by Sabetai Sevi in the seventeenth century.

    Everywhere, Muslims were haunted by the thought that they were losing the state (devlet elden gidiyor, ‘the state is slipping from our hands’, or in the case of Turks who had adopted the terminology of the French Revolution, vatan elden gidiyor, ‘the fatherland is slipping from our hands’). ‘How can the state be saved?’ was the question Muslims asked themselves. But when Ottoman reformers tried to save their dominions by adopting European ways, Muslim conservatives saw another threat, that of losing their traditional religion (din elden gidiyor, ‘[ our] religion is slipping from our hands’).

    The main agents and beneficiaries of progress were foreigners and non-Muslim minorities. The latter tended to see the Ottoman state within which they prospered as a shackle on their energies, a shackle they became increasingly eager to throw off.

    It was customary to give a newborn baby a name when the umbilical cord was cut. This was known as the ‘belly name’ (göbek ismi), and was chosen from among the honorific titles applied to the Prophet Muhammad or other names having a pious connotation. Later the child might be given a second or even third name, by which he or she would become known. The use of two given names was a mark of social distinction.

These were organized in two parallel systems, civil (mülkî) and military (askerî), the first designed primarily to train civil servants, the second officers. In both streams, preparatory schools (rü ￼ tiye) led on to high schools or lycées (idadî) and then on to either the civil service college (Mülkiye) or to the War College (Harbiye) in Istanbul.

Enver’s family came from the old Ottoman fortress of Kili (now Kiliya in Ukrainian Bessarabia), near the mouth of the Danube. He had been born in Istanbul in November 1881 (1297 in the Rumi calendar) and was thus a few months younger than Mustafa Kemal.

    The first was led by Ahmet Rıza, a former education official, who had adopted the philosophy of French positivists, and even used the positivist calendar in his paper Me ￼ veret (published both in Turkish and in French under the title of La Consultation). Positivism, the philosophy elaborated by Auguste Comte (1798–1857), saw empirical science, including the new science of sociology, as the successor of revealed religion. Religion had its uses, but it had also had its day. The idea appealed to those members of the Ottoman elite who sought a place in the civilized world of the West. Ahmet Rıza was of their number. The positivists’ slogan ‘Order and Progress’ was reflected in his organization’s title ‘Union and Progress’, the word ‘union’ referring to the ideal of the fraternal coexistence of all the ethnic groups (known in French as éléments, a term of which the Ottoman Turkish anasır was the exact translation) in the Ottoman state.

    Mustafa Kemal argued that In the Balkans, we should keep both eastern and western Thrace, and the frontier to the north of Edirne should be rectified at the expense of Bulgaria. A conference should be held under Ottoman chairmanship in Istanbul with representatives from Albania, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. Ottoman possessions in the Balkans, outside Thrace, should be ceded to these countries on the basis of national majorities. Albania should become independent. Bosnia-Herzegovina should be shared fairly between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. The [Aegean] islands near the coast of Anatolia should remain within the Turkish state, and the rest should go to Greece. Our southern borders should take in the provinces of Hatay, Aleppo and Mosul, and the rest should be ceded to the Arabs. There should be no change in the east and north-east of Anatolia. Any Greek, Bulgarian and Serb minorities left in Turkey should be exchanged against Turks left outside [the new frontiers].

    Occasionally, Mustafa Kemal listened, and to no one more carefully than to Ziya (Gökalp), an intellectual born in Diyarbakır, in the Kurdish area, and trained in the military veterinary school, from which he was expelled, and then briefly imprisoned for revolutionary activities. Like many of his contemporaries, Gökalp was strongly influenced by French writers, in his case particularly by the sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), from whom he derived his notion of religion as social cement. Religion, Gökalp believed, inspired culture, which was specific to individual national societies, while civilization, meaning primarily science and technology, was universal. Like other members of the CUP, Gökalp started by defending the concept of a common Ottoman patriotism. 62 But, before long, he became the chief ideologist of a Western-oriented Turkish nationalism, based not on ethnic origin, but on common culture and language.

These unfortunates are rather the victims of circumstances which do not permit the observance of this pleasant rule, perhaps because they are afraid of marriage.’ 10 Mustafa Kemal was referring to himself: courageous, decisive and intensely ambitious in the world of men, he was excessively courteous, but essentially shy with women of his new social rank, whose company he enjoyed. When he finally married, briefly and unsuccessfully, it was his young bride who had made the running.

    The transformation of the Bulgarians had amazed the Turks. The Bulgarians had been generally regarded as among the most backward of the sultan’s subjects. The American missionary Cyrus Hamlin, the founder of Robert College (whose premises now house the University of the Bosphorus) in Istanbul, remembered that in the middle years of the nineteenth century, ‘Every spring, there was an advent of Bulgarian shepherds and ostlers in the streets of the capital –strong, rude men in sheepskin clothing, with their shrieking bagpipes and rude country dances, dashing their sheepskin caps upon the pavement to every passer-by for bakshish. They seemed but little above savage life.’ 13 The Bulgarians attributed their progress to the work of ‘popular enlighteners’ –nationalist teachers who imparted new learning as they went out to the people in the spirit of the Russian narodniks (populists). Their example was not lost on Mustafa Kemal, who was later to adopt populism (balkçılık) as one of the six basic principles of the Turkish republic.

    Enver is usually described as pro-German. In fact, like the other CUP members, he was first and foremost an Ottoman patriot. But he was convinced of the superiority of the German army over those of the Entente. His experience in Libya had also led him to believe that Muslims everywhere would rise in response to a call made in the name of the Ottoman sultan caliph. He had in mind Egypt, which was under British control, Persia, which Russia and Britain had divided into zones of influence, the precariously independent emirate of Afghanistan, and the Muslim subjects of Russia in central Asia and Transcaucasia, of Britain in India and of France in North Africa. Based on almost total ignorance of Muslims outside the Ottoman state, Enver’s hopes of effective Muslim and Turkic solidarity under Ottoman leadership were shared by Kaiser Wilhelm, whose thinking was influenced by German orientalists, many of them excellent scholars but poor political advisers.

This order, which was found on the body of a dead Turkish soldier, read: ‘I do not expect that any of us would not rather die than repeat the shame-fill story of the Balkan war.

But as more men were called up, the strength of the army was maintained: there were more than 700,000 men under arms at the end of 1916, and, at least theoretically, 560,000 when the armistice was signed in 1918.38

    It was in these areas –from west to east: in Thrace, western Anatolia, the central and eastern Black Sea coast, eastern and southern Anatolia –that Muslims began to organize in defence of the preservation of their rule, their homes and, ultimately, their lives. Appealing to President Wilson’s endorsement of the right of nations to self-determination, these Muslim organizations generally called themselves Societies for the Defence of National Rights. Two such societies had been founded in Edirne and ￼ zmir on 1 December 1918. The first claimed the whole of Thrace –eastern and western –for its Muslim inhabitants, the second sought to prevent a Greek occupation of Aegean Turkey.

Their number had been swollen by the arrival of Circassian and other Muslim refugees from the Caucasus.

Karabekir wanted the leadership of national resistance to be collegiate; Mustafa Kemal saw himself as the supreme leader.

They did not think only of the weakness of the country after its defeat in the Great War. There was also the backwardness of its people by the standards of ‘modern civilization’. A convinced Turkish nationalist, Riza Nur, was to write after his break with Mustafa Kemal: If America were to accept the mandate and behave in a just and honest manner, it could within twenty years bring us a degree of development which Turks, left to themselves, would not be able to achieve in a century. It would make Turkey prosperous, rich and happy and turn Turks into a strong and civilized nation. Look at Egypt under the British. Its population has grown by some ten million in thirty years.

Harbord recommended that a single US mandate should cover both Armenia and much of Turkey; ‘there is no wisdom,’ the mission report argued, ‘in now incorporating Turkish territory in a separate Armenia, no matter what the aspirations of the Armenians.’ 131 But President Wilson gave his support to Armenian claims the following year, and in any case the proposal for a mandate over Ottoman lands was never put to the US Congress.

But the portions within the lines are an indivisible part of the Ottoman community.’ However, independence was not enough. ‘I believe that an important patriotic and national duty lies beyond it.

    On the same day, the ￼ eyhülislâm, as chief cleric of the Ottoman state, published a decree of outlawry in the form of a canonical decision (fetva), declaring that the nationalist forces were infidels, and that it was incumbent on believers to kill them. Five days later, this was answered by a contrary fetva, drawn up by the nationalist müftü of Ankara, Rifat (Börekçi), and signed by 250 of his colleagues throughout Anatolia. 4 It declared that the caliph was the prisoner of infidels, that it was the duty of the faithful to save him and his dominions, and that fetvas issued at the behest of enemy states lacked validity.

    Mustafa Kemal proposed that the assembly should designate those of its own members whom it wished to exercise executive functions. It was, he said, a basic Islamic principle to grant the greatest authority to the united mass of believers. 12 The term for the latter was cumhur, from which Ottoman lexicographers had coined the word cumhuriyet to designate the republic established in France after the revolution.

    But the principle of an assembly, exercising both legislative and executive powers, had also found a contemporary expression in Russian Soviets. And the term which he proposed to designate ministers, vekil, whose literal meaning was deputy or representative, was translated into French as commissaire, commissioner or commissar. 14 The title of the government of the Grand National Assembly (Committee of Executive Commissioners: ￼ cra Vekilleri Heyeti or Heyet-i Vekile) bore an unmistakable similarity to the Committee of Executive Commissars (Ispolkom for short), as the Soviet government called itself.

    The following day, Mustafa Kemal issued his first proclamation to the nation as president of the Grand National Assembly. ‘We, your deputies, swear in the name of God and the Prophet,’ he declared, ‘that the claim that we are rebels against the sultan and caliph is a lie. All we want is to save our country from sharing the fate of India and Egypt.’ 18 A day later Mustafa Kemal sent a businesslike telegram to the government in Moscow. It opened with these words: ‘We agree to cooperate with Russian Bolsheviks in their efforts to save the oppressed from imperialist governments.’ If the Bolsheviks moved against Georgia to incorporate it into their state and remove British forces from it, Turkey would undertake to take action against ‘the imperialist Armenian government’ and to ensure that Azerbaijan became a member of the Bolshevik ‘group of states’. In the meantime, Mustafa Kemal requested that the Bolsheviks should send ‘a first instalment of five million gold [roubles]’ as well as ammunition, equipment and sanitary supplies. 19 It was the beginning of a long process of bargaining.

    The Allies had organized a signature ceremony at Sevres, the Paris suburb which is home to the renowned French porcelain works. It was there, on 10 August 1920, that three Ottoman plenipotentiaries –a little-known former education minister, the ambassador to Switzerland and a distinguished poet, Riza Tevfik, known as ‘the philosopher’ –signed the treaty which put an end to the Ottoman empire in all but name. The fact that the loss of Ottoman territory was to be gradual fooled no one: the ￼ zmir area would vote on incorporation in Greece within five years; President Wilson would determine the frontiers of Armenia; the League of Nations would decide whether the Kurds were capable of independence, should they wish it. 45 The sultan retained Istanbul, but under Allied control, and the rest of Anatolia, apart from large zones of influence granted under a separate document to France in the south-east, and to Italy in the south. Foreigners would retain the privileged status which they had enjoyed under the capitulations. No patriotic Turk could be expected to accept such a dispensation.

    The Greek army was well equipped and had access to European arms factories. Turkish nationalists had only the caches of arms which they had preserved from the hands of Allied control officers; there was little or no money to buy fresh supplies. The only way out was to divide the enemies and acquire foreign friends. Mustafa Kemal put all his skills to this task. He had to act as a politician and diplomat first, and as a soldier second. He had to be patient and cunning enough to avoid dangerous commitments. Few of his companions understood the need or Mustafa Kemal’s skill in meeting it.

    The question of Turkey’s representation in Moscow was further complicated by the arrival of Enver Pa ￼ a on 7 August. Undeterred by the collapse of his policies in the Great War, Enver fancied himself the leader of a vast Islamic revolutionary organization.

    Sympathy for Communism was strongest among CUP militants. They had started as revolutionary nationalists. Now some of them, particularly the intellectuals of the party, had begun to toy with revolutionary internationalism. Lenin’s promise to emancipate the subject nationalities of the tsarist empire had also made an impression on the Circassians settled in Turkey. The Circassian guerrilla leader Ethem was, as he said in his memoirs, ‘an enthusiastic and sincere partisan of Soviet friendship, until the day when the sublime and attractive principles concerning the freedom of nationalities, which Lenin proclaimed, were violated by the Soviets themselves’. Ethem fancied that ‘among the leaders of the Turkish revolution, it was I whom the Moscow comrades trusted most.’ 19 In May 1920, a semi-clandestine organization called the Green Army (Ye ￼ il Ordu) emerged in Ankara, 20 its programme combining Islamic militancy with scraps of socialist ideology: 21 it attracted several of Mustafa Kemal’s comrades.

    Many members of the assembly had long argued that instead of devoting himself to politics, Mustafa Kemal should take over direct command of the army. A proposal to name Mustafa Kemal commander-in-chief came up for discussion at a closed meeting on 4 August. It could be seen as a revolutionary move, for under the Ottoman constitution, the tide of commander-in-chief was vested in the sultan. But Mustafa Kemal saw a threat as well as an opportunity. He was to argue in 1927 that his opponents in the assembly hoped to discard him if he failed in the field. Mustafa Kemal rose to the challenge. He tabled his own proposal, accepting the post of commander-in-chief for a period of three months, on condition that he should be endowed with the full authority of the assembly. This was too much for many members who feared that they would be pushed aside. After lengthy discussions, a compromise was reached on 5 August. Mustafa Kemal would exercise the authority of the assembly in military matters; 57 his appointment as commander-in-chief would be valid for three months, but the assembly could revoke it earlier.

Writing from Istanbul in May 1921, Toynbee observed that in the Yalova area ‘the malignity and inhumanity of the Greek military authorities are undisguised’. In The Western Question in Greece and Turkey, the book he published the following year, Toynbee came to the conclusion that Greece had proved ‘as incapable as Turkey (or for that matter any Western country) of governing well a mixed population containing an alien majority and a minority of her own nationality’.

    To criticism that there were no precedents for the system of direct government by the assembly, Mustafa Kemal responded with the words: ‘We are proud not to be like anyone else. We are like ourselves (Biz bize benzeriz).’ 55 The speech was also notable for Mustafa Kemal’s repudiation of both Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, the idea that all Muslim or all Turkic peoples should come together in one state. All of Turkey’s enemies would join forces to stop such an attempt, he said, which Turkey neither needed nor was strong enough to carry through. ‘We must know our limitations,’ Mustafa Kemal declared, ‘and expend our lives only in the cause of our independence.’ 56 This was to be the basis of his foreign policy and that of his successors.

    Mustafa Kemal intervened with a long account of the history of Islam. He pointed out that there had been impotent Arab caliphs under the rule of Selçuk (Seljuk) Turks in Baghdad from the eleventh century to the Mongol invasion two hundred years later, and then under the Mamluks in Egypt until the Ottoman conquest in title sixteenth century. The functions of caliph, as successor to the Prophet, and of the temporal ruler, or sultan, could therefore be separated. Now temporal rule in Turkey had passed to the assembly, which had the power to designate –and protect –a caliph. On the one hand, the people of Turkey will become daily stronger as a modern and civilized state, and realize increasingly their humanity and identity, without being exposed to the danger of individual treachery, and, on the other, the institution of the caliphate will be exalted as the central link of the spirit, the conscience and the faith of the Islamic world …21 A committee of the assembly was then asked to draft the necessary resolution. Mustafa Kemal said in 1927 that he cut the debate short, telling the committee: Sovereignty and kingship are never decided by academic debate. They are seized by force. The Ottoman dynasty appropriated by force the government of the Turks, and reigned over them for six centuries. Now the Turkish nation has effectively gained possession of its sovereignty… This is an accomplished fact… If those assembled here … see the matter in its natural light, we shall all agree. Otherwise, facts will still prevail, but some heads may roll.

An accomplished painter in the French classical manner, he set his heart on a fancy-dress caliphate, which, he hoped, would not annoy Ankara. Would it be all right, he asked Mustafa Kemal through Refet, if he appeared at the selâmlik ceremony dressed in robes and a turban, as worn by Mehmet II, the conqueror of Istanbul? 33 No it would not, he was told: he should wear a frock coat, and on no account a military uniform.

    ￼ smet fought tenaciously for Mosul: the province was known to contain rich oil deposits, and, perhaps more importantly, if its predominantly Kurdish population were severed from the more numerous Kurds in eastern Turkey, separatists among the latter would find support across the border. Neither Mustafa Kemal nor any other leading Turkish nationalist denied at the time that there were Kurds in Turkey. But they argued that Turks and Kurds were indissolubly linked by a common history and interests, and should be considered an indivisible national entity. To detach Mosul from Turkey would bring division. As ￼ smet was to say to the British ambassador in Ankara in 1925: ‘So long as any large number of Kurds are included in Iraq the Turkish government would have perpetual trouble in their eastern provinces and trouble would arise automatically, however loyally the British authorities might act as neighbours.’ 38 This was Mustafa Kemal’s opinion from the start.

It was better that Greeks and Bulgarians should fight over it, and that all Turks in Macedonia and western Thrace should be repatriated to reinforce the depleted population of Turkey. ‘We should give up all thought of mounting expeditions in Europe to return there,’ he declared. 40 Eastern Thrace and, with it, the European portion of Istanbul could be defended only by diplomatic and not by military means. This is why negotiations on the straits were nearing agreement. 41 But on one point Mustafa Kemal was adamant: the capitulations had to go, and with them all unequal concessions to foreigners and minorities, all interference in Turkey’s internal affairs. Turkey’s total independence was not negotiable.

    A special coach had been attached to it: the governor of Istanbul had travelled in it to meet the exiles. He handed them an envelope containing £ 2,000 in British banknotes, and the temporary entry visas which had been granted by the Swiss consulate. Abdülmecit responded by issuing a press statement saying that he would obey the nation’s verdict and that he intended to devote himself to fine arts. But the caliph’s resignation did not last long. As soon as the train had crossed the Bulgarian border, he issued a second statement declaring that he considered the decision to depose him to be null and void. Sadly, he was to discover that few people cared. He was held up at the Swiss frontier, as the authorities arranged to exempt him from a law which barred polygamous immigrants. He soon found Switzerland too expensive, and moved to Nice. He died in Paris in August 1944, and was buried in Medina. Requests by Abdülmecit’s descendants to have his remains transferred to Turkey were turned down repeatedly. A few days after Abdülmecit’s expulsion, another 116 members of the dynasty followed him into exile. 45 Most of them never saw Istanbul again. The ban on re-entering Turkey was lifted for female descendants of the Ottoman dynasty in 1952 and for male descendants only in 1974 –fifty years after the expulsion.

But, as Fahrettin (Altay), the newly appointed 2nd Army inspector, noted: ‘Embarrassment and timidity were not yet banished.’ After lunch, Mustafa Kemal took his friends for a walk as far as a local hotel. No sooner had they settled down to coffee than Lâtife arrived unannounced. ‘Kemal,’ she said, ‘I have come to take you home for tea.’ Mustafa Kemal, who hated being called ‘Kemal’, got up furious. Lâtife had clearly decided to prevent a drinking session. ‘I was surprised,’ General Fahrettin wrote in his memoirs, ‘that this cultured and sensitive lady did not realize that her behaviour would upset a man like Atatürk.’ 25 Discord within the president’s family appeared to echo political discord in the country.

However, the British were ‘to keep in with Kurdish revolutionaries as a necessary precaution’ 32 against Turkish encroachment into the disputed province of Mosul. Although this policy was ultimately to contribute to a settlement of the Mosul dispute, it could easily be misunderstood both by the Turkish government and by disaffected Kurds.

    Reports were commissioned from Fethi’s finance minister (and future assembly speaker) Abdülhalik (Renda), and the interior minister Cemil (Uybadin). Abdülhalik was a native of Yanya (Yanina, now in Greece), and probably of Albanian origin; Cemil came from Süleymaniye. 71 But they both came out in favour of a policy of assimilation, which was to be promoted by suppressing the Kurdish language, settling Turks among Kurds, and moving some Kurds to the west. Interior minister Cemil proposed in his report that ‘colonial administration should be introduced in the east under a governor-general’. 72 It was not a shocking idea at a time when the British were using aircraft to bomb the Kurds into submission in northern Iraq and the French and Spanish were suppressing Abdelkrim’s Moroccan tribesmen in the Rif. The difference was that Britain and France had the money to bring material improvements to tribal areas in their colonies; Turkey did not. But this did not affect the presumption that civilized government had a duty to control unruly tribesmen whether it was on the north-west frontier of India or the south-east frontier of Turkey. The conclusions of the enquiry reports were embodied in the Reform Plan for the East ￼ ark Islahat Plâni), submitted to the government in September 1925. It provided for special administrative arrangements for the Kurdish areas under an Inspector-General, the settlement of 50,000 Turks in properties earlier belonging to Armenians, the exile of ‘dangerous’ Kurdish families, and the exclusion of ethnic Kurds from government service in their home areas. 73 ￼ smet, whose family came from the east Anatolian town of Malatya –a fact which led to speculation that he was himself, at least partly, of Kurdish origin –implemented the Eastern Reform Plan. But the ethnic character of the Kurdish areas, where, according to Abdülhalik (Renda), there were almost a million Kurds, against 250,000 Turks and 117,000 Arabic-speakers, 74 did not change appreciably. With time, railways and the improvement in government services knit the country closer together, but most Kurds retained a sense of separateness, and their home areas continued to be poor and backward –a place of exile for unwilling civil servants.

Mustafa Kemal was a conservative revolutionary. He believed that civilization and law and order were inseparable. 79 He opted for both.

    In the first half of the nineteenth century, the reforming Sultan Mahmut II restricted the turban to religious dignitaries, and introduced the fez for civil and military officials. The fez had evolved out of the red, soft felt cap of Mediterranean sailors and derived its name from Fez or Fès, one of the four capitals of Morocco. The fact that it did not have a rim or peak made it particularly suitable for Muslims, whose foreheads have to touch the ground as they prostrate themselves in canonical prayer. Imposed by edict, the fez had been taken to heart by the Ottoman Muslim middle class, although it was sometimes worn also by Ottoman Christians. However, as the latter fell under the spell of Europe, many of them adopted the rimmed European hat, known in Turkey by the Russian word ￼ apka (shapka), derived from the French chapeau. For the majority of Ottoman Turks, ￼ apka was the distinguishing mark of the infidel.

    On 9/ 10 April 1928 the assembly removed from the constitution all references to Islam, as he had forecast in his speech. Islam ceased to be the official religion; parliament no longer had to give effect to Muslim canon law, and oaths of office were secularized. 30 The process of secularization, which had taken a big step forward with the abolition of the caliphate, was now complete. The new secular republic reflected Mustafa Kemal’s personal philosophy. In a book published in 1928, Grace Ellison quotes him as saying to her, presumably in 1926–7: I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap. My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go. Let them worship as they will; every man can follow his own conscience, provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him act against the liberty of his fellow-men. 31 Yet, like many rationalists, Mustafa Kemal was himself superstitious and sought omens in dreams. 32 When he inspected the front in March 1922, during the War of Independence, he had portions of the Koran recited during evening gatherings with commanders. 33 But now he was out of the wood.

    In June 1928, Mustafa Kemal set up a committee in Ankara to recommend the best way of adapting the Latin alphabet to Turkish phonetics. 36 The journalist Falih Rifki presented the commission’s conclusions to the Gazi in Istanbul, who simplified them further. One recommendation was that the letter ‘q’ should be used to render the sound of the soft (palatalized) ‘k’: since Mustafa Kemal preferred to spell his name with a ‘K’, the proposal was dropped. 37 It was decided to adopt a purely phonetic spelling, based on Istanbul educated speech, which was close to Mustafa Kemal’s native Balkan Turkish dialect. Most letters would have the values they had in French or German, and there would be a separate single letter for all the main sounds of spoken Turkish. This required the use of marks (cedilla, circumflex, breve) to modify the standard Latin alphabet. Foreign words, including borrowings from Arabic, would be written as pronounced in Turkish.

    The commission thought that the change to the Latin alphabet would take between five and fifteen years. ‘It will be done in three months or not at all,’ Mustafa Kemal retorted, adding that if both scripts were used in parallel, people would stick to the script which they knew best. He chose a popular gathering in Istanbul on 9 August 1928 to announce the adoption of the Latin alphabet. He decided to present it as a change from Arabic to ‘Turkish letters’: the script of the infidel Franks thus became the alphabet of patriotic, nationalist Turks.

    Mustafa Kemal’s interest in history had practical aims. Racist theories were rife in his lifetime, and President Wilson’s advocacy of national self-determination had not displaced the belief that ownership of territory had to be justified in terms of ‘historic rights’. The territory of Turkey was littered with monuments left by Hittites, Phrygians, Lydians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Armenians. Did this mean that the Turks, who were latecomers to the land, had no ‘historic right’ to it? The main Turkish monuments were either mosques or fortifications. Did that mean that the Turks’ contribution to civilization was restricted to a Muslim culture, frozen in its medieval mould, and to the art of war, and that they were incapable of anything else?

    This posited that all the peoples who had lived in and around Turkey were of Turkish origin –Elamites and Sumerians, Akkadians and Scythians, Achaeans and other early Greek tribes, not to mention Hittites, Phrygians, Lydians, Carians, the people of Urartu and anyone else who left a civilized memorial behind. Ergo, the Turks had a historic right to their land, had created great civilizations, and were capable of contributing to the one, universal, modern civilization. It would have been simpler to say that the Turks had a right to the land because they lived in it and formed the overwhelming majority of its population, and that they were as capable of acquiring and contributing to the sum of human knowledge as any other community which is given the chance. 2 Mustafa Kemal did his best to give his people that chance, but he could not step outside a debate whose terms had been dictated by the masters of the contemporary universe. In any case, he was an avid reader of history and believed in its value. Unfortunately, this led him to promote the production of fantastic tales.

    Unscientific history, made up to serve political purposes, was the exotic fruit of a rationalism which rejected all religious and other metaphysical doctrines. ‘One must accept,’ the Outline of Turkish History declared, ‘that life is the natural and necessary outcome of chemical and physical processes, unaffected by any external intervention from outside nature.’ 3 Nevertheless, religion is an important social and psychological phenomenon, subject to evolution. But now that man has discovered his strength, society has become the source of contentment and security, and the basis for humanity’s further progress in maturity. 4 Mustafa Kemal’s historiography was the product of his clash with domestic Islam and foreign detractors. He hoped that apart from giving his people confidence in their abilities, it would make them better and more knowledgeable guardians of the artistic monuments that form the pre-Islamic heritage of their country. To some extent this has happened.

    Mustafa Kemal gave it the task of simplifying and purifying the language by bringing written Turkish closer to the spoken tongue and by trawling dictionaries of various Turkic languages (composed mainly by foreigners) for ‘pure’ Turkish words which had fallen into disuse. In addition, researchers were asked to travel the length and breadth of the country to record Turkish words which had survived only in provincial usage. In fact the laudable aim of simplification was compromised by the ideal of purification. An adequate ‘pure’ Turkish vocabulary could not be formed by reviving old-fashioned and provincial words and quarrying central Asian Turkic languages (and sometimes importing from them words of Mongol or Indo-European Sogdian origin under the misapprehension that they were ‘pure’ Turkish).

    A complementary approach was found fortuitously the following year. Mustafa Kemal was shown a paper sent in by a Dr Hermann Kvergi ￼ of Vienna who argued that all languages derived from exclamations made by primitive man as he contemplated nature, and that the original sounds so uttered were embedded in Turkish. With Mustafa Kemal’s enthusiastic support, this unprovable hypothesis was developed into the Sun-Language Theory (Güne ￼ Dil Teorisi), named thus because ‘it is among us Turks that, in the journey of history, the inspiration of the Sun has left its most abundant marks.

    The Sun-Language Theory, like the Turkish history thesis, was a wayward product of rationalism: of nineteenth-century theories about ‘the great migration of peoples’, applied first to the Indo-Europeans and now transposed to the Turks; of animism as the origin of religion (‘ The Turk worships only nature,’ Mustafa Kemal told a German journalist in 192910); of the Marxist theory (developed by Nikolay Marr, who visited Turkey) that language was part of the ‘superstructure’ determined by the economic ‘infrastructure’ of society. Mustafa Kemal’s wishful thinking shaped the conclusion that the Turks, as Sun-worshippers par excellence, were also the originators of language. It was a convenient conclusion. If all languages derived from Turkish, the Turks were only getting their own back when they borrowed words from other languages, and, particularly, from the languages of civilized Western peoples.

    The description of the ruler as father of his people was commonplace: Abdülhamit II, reviled by Western liberals as the Red (bloody) Sultan, was known to Muslim Turks as Baba Hamit, Daddy Hamit. Ata was grander, signifying not only a father, but the progenitor of a line.

    The egalitarian impact of the general adoption of surnames was reinforced by two further measures.

    A resettlement law passed in 193421 classified the territory of the republic under three headings: areas where the number of people of Turkish culture should be increased; areas where people who were to be assimilated to Turkish culture were to be transferred; and areas to be evacuated. Immigrants who were not of ‘Turkish race’ were to be settled at the discretion of the government. People who were not ‘attached to Turkish culture’, anarchists, spies and nomadic gypsies, were not allowed into the country. The following year, permanent military government was established in the Dersim mountains (renamed the province of Tunceli, literally ‘Bronze-land’ on the assumption that it had been inhabited by Turks since the Bronze Age). The military governor was authorized to relocate the population and ratify death sentences.

He even made the law stricter in 1941 when it became a criminal offence to recite the call to prayer in Arabic. 7 Atatürk’s policy of reducing the use of Arabic and Persian loanwords was pushed forward, and in 1945 the constitution was rewritten in pure Turkish, and Turkish names were invented for four calendar months (October to January), which had previously borne Arabic names.

    French laïcisme could not be applied logically to a Muslim society. The principle that religion is a private matter is inconsistent with historical Islam. The Koran is not only a compendium of moral principles; it is also the constitution of the state created by Muhammad –its civil and criminal law. The practice of the Prophet, his sunna, which together with the Koran forms the basis of Muslim religious law, prescribes details of social and individual behaviour. Ingenious religious scholars can, of course, interpret, even explain away, the holy law. But to deny its validity is a revolutionary act for a Muslim. This is what Atatürk did after abolishing the caliphate in 1924.

    However, Atatürk did not see himself as a religious reformer. He was a rationalist, and at least after 1924, the books he sponsored promoted a materialist and determinist ideology.

    It is true that he often failed to practise what he preached. In his private life, he could not accept women as equals. He did not travel abroad, probably because he would have felt uncomfortable in a world to which he was leading his fellow-countrymen, His rationalism and attachment to ‘positive science’ did not stop him inventing fantastic historical and linguistic theories. A democrat in theory, he created his own cult and was convinced that he was always right. He worshipped reason, while persisting in unreasonable personal habits. No matter, his vision was humanist and universalist. His cult of youth –a widespread contemporary phenomenon –served to combat ignorance and not presumed national, racial or class enemies as in Italy, Germany and Soviet Russia. His advice ‘Be proud, confident and hard-working’ brought the philosophy of Samuel Smiles to Turkey. When restraints on private initiative were relaxed after the Second World War, the spirit of self-reliance, which Atatürk had fostered, helped transform a backward country into the world’s seventeenth largest economy.

    On the Kurds and other ethnic groups in Turkey, Atatürk shared the views of reforming Turkish nationalists. Namik Kemal, the ‘poet of liberty’ who had inspired Mustafa Kemal in his youth, had written as early as 1878: ‘We must try to annihilate all languages in our country except Turkish … Language … may be the firmest barrier –perhaps firmer than religion –against national unity.’ 24 During the War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal made separate mention of the Kurds, but always as ‘brothers’ whose fate was indissolubly linked with that of the Turks; 25 he said that he envisaged autonomy for the Kurds within a general system of local self-government. 26 But in 1924, after the war had been won, the new republican constitution set up a centralized state, and pressure was brought to bear on all citizens to speak Turkish. 27
