    Exile groups counter that the unrest is not the work of separatists but a reaction to marginalization and that Tibetan and Uyghur frustrations have reached a boiling point (ICT 2008). Exile groups and disaffected members of the wider ethnic communities charge that Tibetans and Uyghurs are being marginalized culturally and economically in their homelands and that their rights are being systematically violated. According to this view, ethnic unrest is triggered by a deterioration in “ethnic security”—people’s perceptions of their ability to preserve, express, and develop their ethnic distinctiveness in everyday economic, social, and cultural practices (Wolf 2006; Horowitz 2000).

    In Uyghur and Tibetan areas propaganda slogans (kouhao) are a hallmark of the urban landscape. Posters and billboards celebrate economic development and progress and promote patriotism.

    An important difference between propaganda in the national media and that communicated via billboards and posters is that whereas the former is aimed at immediate consumption, the latter is typically displayed for long periods to maximize its impact. Furthermore, while propaganda in the news media is filtered and shaped by journalists, state propaganda in the streets comes directly from party officials, cadres, and the nomenklatura at the local level and is thus unmediated by the cosmetics of general news coverage.

    However, a number of scholars outside China have observed that such concerns underline a tendency within China to apply the “terrorist” label to all forms of ethnic protest (Economy 2013; Roberts 2013; Cook 2013; and Hillman, this volume). State propaganda confirms that authorities make insufficient distinction between antistate terrorism and everyday protest against state policies (Wall Street Journal 2013). This delegitimizes and, in some cases, criminalizes ethnic protests, which further fuels resentments and undermines the CCP’s nation-building efforts in Xinjiang and Tibet.

    In the decades since the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, the relative thaw in prohibitions against religious practices among ethnic minorities fueled the emergence of nationalistic sentiments and separatist interests among sections of the Uyghur and Tibetan communities, seemingly more so than among other ethnic groups in the PRC.

    For many Tibetans and Uyghurs such slogans devalue ethnic difference and highlight majority Chinese distrust of their ethnic group. This distrust is reinforced by heightened security and discrimination, such as dedicated lines at airport security for Tibetans and Uyghurs (Hillman 2014). The idea of a unified Chinese nation also often appears to be one that embraces Uyghurs and Tibetans only under strict conditions.

    In many instances, however, the language in propaganda materials reflects attitudes that many observers find discriminatory (Mackerras 2004, 221). 24 My interviews among Uyghurs and Tibetans suggest that such daily reminders of the ethnic pecking order are a major source of resentment—resentment that lies at the heart of the recent unrest. They also suggest that propaganda aimed at national unity and nation building often has the opposite effect: it leaves Uyghurs and Tibetans feeling like targeted outsiders. Discriminatory language in state propaganda can fuel resentment in its target audience.

    When David Graeber draws attention to the link between economic disadvantage and popular protest, he speaks to a core theme of this chapter. 1 Even so, I do not mean to suggest that debt and land dispossession are solely responsible for the repeated incidents of Uyghur-Han violence in South Xinjiang and the ongoing interethnic tensions in the region. Restrictions on certain Uyghur religious, cultural, and educational practices appear, from reports since 2009 (CECC 2011; Global Times 2012; Turdush 2013), to be of at least equal importance in this respect.

    First, in rural areas smallholder debt can lead to land dispossession and, consequently, a cycle of indebtedness that is extremely difficult to break free of. Second, in many cases it is debt-financed capital construction projects that produce the demand for land and the smallholders’ separation from it. This process, which Karl Marx termed “primitive accumulation,” is still very much part of economic life in South Xinjiang—

    Lucrative chaos in South Xinjiang is created by the interactions of (mainly Han) entrepreneurs and (mainly Han) government officials in the context of certain large-scale and highly uneven flows of capital. In this political-economic space the stakes are high, and the investment horizon is short. Opportunities appear quickly and are likely to disappear just as quickly, and one cannot take for granted that any given situation or environment will continue or be stable for any length of time.

    In the Foucauldian sense normalization is a process of disciplining through the imposition of precise norms (Foucault 1977). Normalization, in this context, is the process of making Xinjiang more like Neidi and, in particular, making people in Xinjiang more like people in Neidi. Normalization includes providing bilingual education, restricting religious practice and teaching (Human Rights Watch 2005; CECC 2011), “civilizing” the populace, “remaking” history, and reshaping habits (Cliff 2013).

    Second, although the economy is becoming more capitalistic at all levels, there is no sign that “the market” is setting prices and determining resource allocations to a greater extent than in the past. On the contrary, the state and its agents continue to play the largest part. Four years after the GWD officially began, Victor Shih (2004, 427) argued convincingly that “instead of creating the environment and incentives for local businesses to become internationally competitive, the GWD campaign was intentionally an enormous exercise in rent distribution. Politicized bureaucrats used the campaign as a means to consolidate their hold on the party and to increase the power of the central bureaucracy.”

    The policy of supporting the cotton price in order to stabilize farmers’ incomes and social well-being has evident flaws. First, not everybody can be a cotton farmer, and of those left over, not everybody can find work in the industries that gain support from this policy. Second, rising incomes and production costs, along with the massive infrastructure construction going on in Xinjiang, has caused the price of basic commodities like food to double and in some cases triple in the past three years; the cost of living for the poorest people in society thus goes up at almost the same rate. Since the nonstate actors who are most likely to engage directly in violent conflict are these relatively poor people, the effect of investment and agricultural subsidies on overall “stability” in Xinjiang is seriously undermined.

    Government exploitation and deal making are based on the selective application of “market” rules. These “market” rules apply in certain sections of the economy but not others, and to certain individual or corporate entities but not others. The bingtuan political economy is perhaps the archetype in this respect. The result is a formalized hierarchy of differential rights that would not be permissible under normal Chinese law (Cliff 2009). A second example is predatory bank lending as described above.

Other non-bingtuan farmers have told me the same. 20 In other words most significant threats and opportunities arise from state action or lack thereof: “reading the market” means “reading the state.” Uyghurs are ill-positioned to read the state in this way. But they are not unaffected by the changes in Xinjiang’s economic structure. They are largely excluded from the lucrative but very much included in the chaos.

    cannot be like us [Han].” One glaring contradiction here is that the implicit promise of Han-style cultural and economic modernization appears to be that “you only have to be like us in order to enjoy that which we enjoy.” Uyghurs could make a legitimate complaint that “you won’t let us be like us, and you won’t let us be like you.” This resonates with Duara’s (2001, 106) formulation that “the desire is not (simply) to conquer the other, but to be desired by the other.” 21 The logical conclusion is that the Chinese state wants to change Uyghurs into something that is neither the Uyghur of today nor the Han of today but rather a modified and completely imaginary Uyghur zhonghuaminzu. 22 In other words Uyghurs are likely to feel that they have little living space left and that not only do they have nothing, but they also owe a great deal. State-linked discourses repeatedly emphasize what the CCP and the Han have done for the ethnic minorities and minority areas—a discourse of minority indebtedness. 23 The whole premise of “Assist Xinjiang” is indebtedness. This indebtedness is both financial and moral, and the debtors and the creditors are specifically identified. Xinjiang is in debt to Neidi; Xinjiang people (both Han and Uyghur) are collectively indebted to their Neidi “compatriots.” Of course, it is not stated like that. “Assist Xinjiang” is posed as an act of selfless giving by the more developed eastern Chinese people to the poorer and more backward western Chinese people. The gift is simultaneously an act of inclusiveness and of differentiation. But a gift is a debt (Mauss 1966), and both work in similar ways to tie the giver and receiver together.

    “Assist Xinjiang” is just one aspect of an ongoing series of exchanges—of people, minerals, money, even ideas—between Xinjiang and Neidi. People in Xinjiang cannot but be aware of the tightening of this web of indebtedness. On the one hand, Han people in Xinjiang shrug off the largess of the central government as a stability measure. They do not feel burdened by the implied debt because they know that they are also measures of stability themselves; they are doing their part. Indeed, they are in some small but important sense part of the gift. Uyghurs, on the other hand, are always being told that they are the cause of instability. Their very presence is debt-creating. Receiving a gift that is overvalued by the giver, especially if it is a gift that is unwanted in the first place, is an uncomfortable feeling. The useless gift puts one in debt, for an unreasonable sum, to a creditor that is seen from the outset as a burden. Graeber writes: Tell people they are inferior, they are unlikely to be pleased, but this surprisingly rarely leads to armed revolt. Tell people that they are potential equals who have failed, and that therefore, even what they do have they do not deserve, that it isn’t rightly theirs, and you are much more likely to inspire rage. . . . For thousands of years, the struggle between rich and poor has largely taken the form of conflicts between creditors and debtors—of arguments about the rights and wrongs of interest payments, debt peonage, amnesty, repossession, restitution, the sequestering of sheep, the seizing of vineyards. . . . By the same token, for the last five thousand years, with remarkable regularity, popular insurrections have begun the same way: with the ritual destruction of the debt records. (2011, 8) In Xinjiang in the early 2010s, the gift of Han-style cultural and economic normalization manifests as an unquantifiable, by definition unrepayable, moral debt. Sporadic examples of violence involving Uyghur people in rural areas of South Xinjiang can be viewed from this perspective as a rejection of the normalizing project and its manifestations in Xinjiang: a “destruction of the debt records.”

    Uyghur entrepreneurs, I suggest, cluster in fringe industries and markets where they have a cultural advantage, and they rely almost exclusively on networks with fellow Uyghurs to obtain resources and capital. This restricts their ability to compete with Han firms and stifles long-term growth. I show, however, that the few Uyghur entrepreneurs who have managed to expand their businesses—to “break out” of the ethnic enclave—have built relationships with Han firms and government officials.

    But concentration in a few market niches leads to stiff competition and high business failure rates within the ethnic enclave.

    I will argue that the current wave of interethnic conflict in Xinjiang and Tibet is the exception rather than the norm and that at a national level ethnic relations remain relatively robust and thus pose little immediate threat to regime stability and territorial integrity. Yet this could quickly alter if the party-state initiates a new round of major reforms, atrophies further, or suddenly collapses, as weak governance and shifting policies (rather than group inequality or cultural marginality) are the chief accelerants of interethnic violence.

    In an influential article first published in the Hong Kong magazine Leaders (Lingdaozhe) and subsequently circulated across the Sino-phone Internet, Beijing University sociologist Ma Rong argues that “the biggest challenge that China could face in the twenty-first century is the break-up of the state” (Ma 2012). Ma forcefully asserts that by uncritically inheriting the “nationality theory” (minzu lilun) of the former Soviet Union and its Comintern advisers, the CCP created the three “prerequisite conditions” for ethnic-based disintegration, each of which directly contributed to the collapse of the USSR and Yugoslavia: (1) the existence of strong ethnic consciousness, which leads ethnic groups to reject their inclusion within a unified nation-state; (2) the existence of separately administered territories that ethnic groups considered their homeland; and (3) the existence of an ethnic leadership, namely a group of political and cultural elites capable of initiating and leading an independence movement.

    Current policies, including the system of regional ethnic autonomy and minzu-based affirmative action, have reinforced ethnic boundaries. State-defined categories are not only stamped on one’s personal ID card but are also increasingly part of daily life in China. As a result, cross-cultural interactions are easily “ethnicized,” with a complex matrix of discursive stereotypes employed by Han when contrasting the “exotic,” “docile,” and “feminine” minorities of the southwest with the “barbaric,” “restive,” and “masculine” minorities of the formally nomadic northwest steppe (McCarthy 2009). Negative images of “knife-wielding” Tibetan and Uyghur “savages” engender fear and even hatred among many Han residents, and when minorities find themselves in coastal cities through either “labor-export” programs (laowu paichu), inland schooling (neidiban), or more spontaneous forms of migration, heightened ethnic prejudices and consciousness are inevitable and conflict predictable. Despite admirable efforts to boost minority livelihood, state policies have been far less successful in cultivating a sense of collective, national belonging among some of China’s ethnic minority communities, particularly the Uyghurs and Tibetans, and to a lesser extent the Hui and Mongols.

    One statistical indicator of ethnic-based residential segregation is the “dissimilarity index” (D-Index), which measures the residential evenness of two ethnic groups across spatial units by determining the percentage of people from one ethnic group that would have to move to another area in order to achieve parity. Based on the 2010 census, the average D-value for minority groups in China was 87.00 at provincial scale, with D-values as high as 98.60 and 88.38 for the Uyghurs and Tibetans respectively (Leibold and Deng, forthcoming). While this represents a decline from a 97 average value in 1982, ethnic residential segregation remains extremely high in China when compared to the 59.10 D-value for black-white segregation and 48.50 value for Hispanic-white segregation across major US cities in 2010, or the 23.40 value for Malays in Chinese-dominated Singapore in 2000 (Logan and Stults 2006). Furthermore, the percentage of non-Han minorities remains extremely low in major metropolitan centers like Beijing (4.1 percent), Shanghai (0.45 percent), Guangzhou (1.35 percent), Wuhan (0.7 percent), Chongqing (6.3 percent), and Tianjin (2.67 percent).

    The size of the minority population (fewer than 120 million) not only pales in significance to the more than one billion people officially registered as Han by the party-state, but a range of other factors—such as the institutional fragmentation of ethnocultural groups (each with their own history, culture, customs, and minzu); intraethnocultural divisions along class, urban/ rural, education, religion, language, and other lines; and the scattered and unequal distribution of minority communities across the PRC’s geobody—impose significant limitations on the importance and influence of ethnic relations to Chinese society and politics as a whole. In the end those minorities that actively resist the current system or seek to undermine Han rule and power are extremely few and largely impotent in the face of overwhelming Han/ state hegemony.

    For China this suggests that any change in the status quo—such as a new round of social and economic reforms, increased transnational ties, political liberalization, and the weakening or collapse of CCP authority—would erode existing demographic, spatial, and security controls and lead to increased ethnic conflict and violence. The implications here are sobering. In spite of widespread domestic and international criticism of current ethnic policies, efforts to either increase minority autonomy or strengthen national integration will likely heighten ethnic competition, enmity, and conflict.

    It would seem that a strong and stable party-state is more conducive to short-term interethnic harmony than an unstable, changing, or democratizing China. As a result the options are stark: continue with targeted ethnic repression and segregation through the state’s monopoly on the legitimate use of violence, or loosen state controls and facilitate ethnic mobility and competition. The former path might keep a lid on tensions at present, but for how long? The latter path will increase ethnic violence over the short-to-medium term, with the (possibly elusive) goal of greater social cohesion and national belonging in the long term. Ironically, the relative lack of interethnic conflict today could ultimately prove detrimental to the long-term sustainability of ethnocultural diversity in China, as the current system exhibits obvious weaknesses in interethnic tolerance, trust, and understanding, as well as the long-term governance, rule of law, and conflict-management strategies necessary for a healthy pluralism.
