    Usually, she told Friedman, research and dissemination of ideas were left to two different sorts of people. But not always. “John Maynard Keynes, for example, did both,” she told him.

    Samuelson’s literary style betrayed his personality. His were the contributions of an established, successful, confident leader in his field whose responses to challenges were largely generous, if sometimes gently patronizing. By contrast, Friedman was something of a street fighter whose right jabs were designed to score points as much as to persuade his endlessly skeptical rival. Friedman’s intention was political, to alter events as they were happening by reason and advocacy. Samuelson tended to the long and broad view, reluctant to engage too readily in every passing controversy.

    With the market in stocks booming through the Twenties and sucking in ordinary Americans looking to make a buck, he started following the stock market and helped his high school algebra teacher pick winners from the stock report in the newspaper. Alas, there is no record of whether Samuelson’s stock picks turned a profit. At age sixteen, displaying a precocious ability in mathematics, Samuelson was allowed early admission to the University of Chicago and discovered there, in his first lecture on his first day, the subject that would fascinate him for the rest of his life. He liked to say, “I was born on January 2, 1932, when I walked into the first University of Chicago classroom.”

    Samuelson was, by all accounts, a pleasure to teach. Viner described him in a report at the time as “a sober, careful and extremely able student, equipped with extensive mathematical technique, zealous, original and independent, without the belligerencies and the arrogance that so often marks young men with keen minds and the knowledge that they are superior in mental capacity to their classmates.” 19 In 1935 Samuelson graduated, after just three years, with a bachelor’s degree. The following year, he completed his master’s. One of Samuelson’s earliest contributions to economic theory was a diagnostic tool used to analyze business cycles, called the multiplier-accelerator, later known as the Hansen-Samuelson model, 20 which attempted to explain the reasons market economies proceed in an established cycle, from boom to bust, and so on.

    In 1951, Samuelson first unveiled his ingenious synthesis of economics old and new. In Principles and Rules in Modern Fiscal Policy: A Neo-Classical Formulation, he spelled out how government policy could minimize unemployment by countering the natural ebb and flow of the business cycle. He said the success of public works programs during the New Deal had been overestimated and that cutting taxes as a means of stimulus had been underestimated. The key to taming the business cycle was fiscal policy: a mixture of public spending and tax changes. He did not mention the role money and the Fed might play in maintaining the appropriate money supply. For Samuelson in 1951, in a period of economics he later referred to as “Model T Keynesianism,” 46 money did not matter. His decision to ignore monetary theory—the assumption that the supply of money in an economy is directly related to inflation—was to become the core of his disagreement with monetarists like Friedman.

    The resulting Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, published in 1960, turned on its head conventional wisdom about the reasons for the Great Depression, blaming not the stock market bubble and the overheated economy, which were suggested by Keynes, but the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide enough money to keep the economy moving. While the conventional view was that the federal government had rightly tightened the cost of borrowing to put an end to the rampant speculation in stocks that had led to the Crash of 1929, Friedman, by trawling through the monetary data, came to a different conclusion: had the Federal Reserve eased interest rates earlier, many of the businesses which had gone bust could have borrowed to remain open.

    The Keynesian revolution in economics had legitimized and emboldened the government sector to overrule market messages and directly manage economies, through state spending on public projects. Vast government building programs had been the trademark of Nazism, which also put the state in charge of the economy. Hayek had a knack of spotting the big picture.

    For Friedman to visit Cambridge, the world capital of Keynesian thought, was in some part an act of courage as, in the eyes of Keynesians, “classical” economists like him were antediluvian outcasts. As one observer put it, to Keynesians, “free-marketeers seemed to occupy something like the eighth ring of the Inferno, the special place for soothsayers, diviners, and magicians, where they are condemned to walk backwards with their heads twisted around.” 48 And the Keynesians’ contempt was dutifully returned to them by free-market economists.

    In her talk, she robustly defended Keynes’s decision to tie the price of currencies to each other. Before World War II, governments had fixed the price of their currencies—and therefore the prices of their exports and imports—to their domestic needs. But the result was often painful. By pegging the pound sterling at too high a price directly after World War I, Britain’s Conservative government had provoked mass unemployment as British exporters struggled to find customers prepared to pay such a high price.

    The traditional view suggested that too much money chasing too few goods—and too few stocks—had led to unsustainably high prices of both stocks and goods, ending in a stock market bubble that burst in the Crash of 1929. But a careful perusal of the contemporary financial data, Friedman and Schwartz argued, suggested a quite different cause: that the tightness of money in circulation—with interest rates kept deliberately high by the Federal Reserve—had led to the string of bank collapses that froze the financial system, spooked the stock market, and triggered the market collapse.

In their Monetary History, Friedman and Schwartz revived the long-ignored quantity theory in an incarnation that would fast become known as “monetarism.”

    At age fifty, he had assembled his insights into money and the role of government into a coherent world view that was not merely a repudiation of Keynesian economics but a critique of the system of democratic government that America had enjoyed since the founding of the Republic. His judgment was that there could be no political freedom if the market was not allowed to operate freely. All attempts to temper the market, however well intended—such as progressive income taxes designed to make society more equal or subsidies or tax breaks to encourage racial or gender equality—were doomed because they hampered the efficient operation of capitalism, which, when left to its own devices, was sure to maximize the benefits to society.

    Capitalism and Freedom was a tour de force, a flagrant bid for attention that slaughtered liberal sacred cows and deposed progressive household gods.

    From this point on, Friedman redefined himself as an evangelist for capitalism with the aim of transforming the Republicans from a moderate party into a dynamic vanguard for radical libertarianism that often ran counter to traditional conservative values. As Friedman pointed out, old conservative prejudices, such as race hatred, had no place in capitalism, which was a disinterested system that treated all people alike.

    Friedman took the dodgers’ side. 29 For him, compulsory military service was an impertinent demand from an overweening state. He considered the draft “inequitable, wasteful, and inconsistent with a free society” and conscription “a weapon … to discourage freedom of speech, assembly, and protest.” 30 He was anxious that a large standing army supported by the military-industrial complex threatened essential freedoms. Instead he suggested armed forces recruited from volunteers.

So an argument that suggested that if the government created a lot of new money the result would likely be short-lived prosperity followed by inflation seemed a reasonable contention.

    Many thought Keynes’s monumental General Theory confusing and hard to grasp. But the main takeaway from Keynes’s revolutionary thinking was simple and did not require a reader to plough through the book. Keynes posed the key questions: Should governments try to prevent unemployment? How could there be widespread unemployment in an economy with unused productive capacity? How can governments restore aggregate demand in an economy when it collapses?

    Friedman’s notion linking changes in the supply and velocity of money to inflation was simple and persuasive: inflation is caused solely by changes in the money supply and the rate at which money chases goods.

    Keynes also challenged the assumption among economists that over time an economy would come to rest at an equilibrium in which, “in the long run,” a constant supply of money would result in stable prices. Keynes argued that it was not the supply of money that was the key to stable prices—the quantity theory of money—but the velocity of money in the system, which could change without notice, leading to constantly changing prices.

    Such intervention interfered with the “natural equilibrium” between savings and investment. If capital goods, such as machine tools not needed by the market, were bought with artificially cheap money, the relationship between savings and investment would hurtle out of kilter. A central bank that kept interest rates artificially low would promote a downward spiral of reducing interest rates, ending with an economy in disarray and a recession.

    Samuelson saw the link between democracy and public spending as a red herring. “Experience with the political economy of social choice [will not] bear out the diagnosis that democracy by its nature must produce overlarge public spending,” he wrote. “The economic principles of collective decision making and of competitive game theory demonstrate that there is as much an inherent tendency for governments to spend too little as too much.”

    Managing an economy elevated the importance and power of public officials and economists, pitting their competence and judgment against the invisible hands of market forces. Friedman agreed with Keynes that an economy could be managed by government, and it was his belief that prices not only could but should be managed—by the central bank controlling the amount of new money entering the system—that caused many free marketeers, including Hayek, to sputter.

    Keynes’s Tract also anticipated a later fashion in economic thinking: the notion of “rational expectations,” or the understanding that as economic actors wittingly anticipate a rise or fall in prices and other changes to the economic landscape when they make decisions, so the price of goods comes to reflect those expectations.

    In linking prices to the quantity of money, Keynes noted, the quantity theory7 assumed that if the quantity of money were doubled, prices would also, in the long run, double. But, he argued, before the quantity of money and the level of prices eventually came into alignment, those holding money or obtaining credit would anticipate the rise in prices and would likely deplete their cash holdings accordingly. Hence, until a new equilibrium was reached—in which the doubling of the amount of money in circulation resulted in the doubling of prices—prices would increase but would not double.

    As Keynesians believed that to boost a sinking economy it was necessary to generate greater demand for goods—thereby promoting more business activity, investment, and jobs—they concluded it was best for governments to direct new stimulus money at the less-well-off, who, unlike the rich, would spend every last cent without delay. To test Keynes’s assumption, Friedman consulted five decades of data15 about U.S. family budgets and concluded that, contrary to Keynes’s contention, people made spending decisions not on their current income but on the state of their “permanent income,” the amount of income a person expected to earn in the long run. So, he said, current income was no guide to whether a person saved or spent new income. Therefore, Friedman asserted, Keynes’s assumptions about how quickly stimulus money—whether from tax cuts or government spending on public works—would be spent were wrong, which undermined the expected multiplier effect of a stimulus.

    Friedman and Schwartz came to a radically different conclusion. The Great Depression was not the result of overexuberance in the market, they argued, but was instead precipitated by the failure of the Federal Reserve to pump enough dollars into the system through lending at low interest rates to prevent the chronic lack of liquidity that ended up driving so many banks to fail and businesses to go bust.

    But, Friedman argued, by keeping rates unnaturally low, politicians and their tame economists were courting disaster. “They received a rude shock when these policies failed in country after country, when central bank after central bank was forced to give up the pretense that it could indefinitely keep ‘the’ rate of interest at a low level,” he said. “Inflation, stimulated by cheap money policies, not the widely heralded postwar depression, turned out to be the order of the day.” However, the inflation apparently stoked by Keynesian fiscal remedies suggested that the quantity of money did matter after all—the mishandling of monetary policy by Keynesian economists had caused prices to rise faster than necessary, he said. That realization was “the beginning of a revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy.”

    While Phillips’s analysis was “deservedly celebrated as an important and original contribution,” it contained “a basic defect—the failure to distinguish between nominal wages and real wages, i.e., the amount of money that a worker was paid compared to the amount of goods and services those wages could buy when inflation was taken into account.” While “there is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment, there is no permanent trade-off,” said Friedman.

    Samuelson described the cause of hyperinflation11 in a Newsweek column: The escalation of the Vietnam war in 1965 produced classical demand-pull inflation—i.e., too much dollar spending chasing a limited supply of goods, with labor markets tight and order backlogs high as even overtime production could not produce as much as was wanted. By 1970, just as the demand-pull inflation was weakening in consequence of tight monetary and fiscal policies, the militant desire of union members to catch up to, and stay ahead of, the inflation led to upward cost-pressure on prices. 12 Like most economists of the time, Samuelson believed inflation was either cost-push—as the cost of labor or raw materials increased, businesses passed on those costs to consumers—or demand-pull—too much demand was chasing too few goods, which drove up prices.

    Inflation could be contained “by two kinds of fiscal restraints: either higher tax rates, or lower rates of government expenditure—or, of course, a combination.” 15 And there was a third way, he said: the Federal Reserve could slow the economy by raising interest rates at the top of the business cycle. This would reduce business activity when inflation and employment were at their height.

On November 1, 1978, in an effort to stem the decline in price of the American dollar, Carter held a press conference announcing an increase in interest rates to 9.5 percent, a move that many, including Samuelson, thought would provoke a recession.

    As the name “supply-side economics” suggests, its adherents were countering Keynes’s remedy of reviving a sluggish economy by deliberately boosting aggregate demand, though Keynes had anticipated the truth at the idea’s kernel in his 1936 General Theory: “Supply creates its own demand in the sense that the aggregate demand price is equal to the aggregate supply price for all levels of output and employment.” Supply-siders asserted that an increase in the supply of goods and services would provide an inflation-proof way of boosting an economy. One way of bolstering demand advocated by Keynes was to cut taxes, allowing individuals to spend more and thereby increase demand. The logic of supply-side economics was in many ways similar to Keynes’s tax-cutting remedy and in turn was merely a variation on Say’s Law, 20 which states, “A product is no

    According to supply-side economics, a large across-the-board equal cut of income tax rates would not reduce but would raise the revenues and so would not increase the deficit but would reduce it. This wonderful consequence would be produced by a large increase in the taxable income base—large enough so that the revenue would be larger even though the tax rates were lower. The large increase in the taxable income base would come about mainly because of a large increase in the total national output and income, resulting in turn from an increase in the quantity of labor and capital supplied when tax rates were reduced and the after-tax return for working and saving was increased.

He always professed to be uncomfortable finding fault with Friedman: “I don’t like criticizing Milton Friedman, not only because he is an old friend but that outside of monetary theory we are in complete agreement.” 57 Yet in 1983, as the Fed complained that it had no means of accurately measuring or managing the quantity of money in the U.S. economy, Hayek asked, “Has monetary policy ever done any good? I don’t think it has. I think it has done only harm.” He continued: It is true that the price level is determined from the quantity of money. But we never know what the quantity of money in this sense is. I think the rule ought to be that whoever issues the money must adapt the quantity so that the price level will remain stable. But to believe there is a measurable magnitude that you can keep constant with beneficial effects is completely wrong.

    The problem is that in its crude form [monetarism] provides no adequate measure of what is the supply of money and that not only the supply of all kinds of money but also the demand for them determines its value. This, however, does not alter the fact that its value can be controlled and can be adequately restricted only by limiting the basic cash supplied under the existing system by the central bank. Since this is a government institution, all inflation is made by government and nobody else can do anything about it. It does, however, make impracticable the Friedmanite plan of fixing by law the rate at which the quantity of money may and should increase.

    Friedman thought liberal intellectuals too stupid to understand the complexities of the market. “I think a major reason why intellectuals tend to move towards collectivism is that the collectivist answer is a simple one,” he told Reason magazine in 1974: If there’s something wrong it’s because of some no-good bum, some devil, evil and wicked—that’s a very simple story to tell. You don’t have to be very smart to write it and you don’t have to be very smart to accept it. On the other hand, the individualistic or libertarian argument is a sophisticated and subtle one. If there’s something wrong with society, if there’s a real social evil, maybe you will make better progress by letting people voluntarily try to eliminate the evil.

While the totalitarian regimes of Hitler’s Germany, 1931–1945, and the military dictatorship in Chile, 1973–1990, clearly enjoyed economic freedom at the expense of political freedom, Samuelson showed that social-democratic countries like Norway in the postwar period enjoyed both political and economic freedoms simultaneously. He concluded, “One can try to have the best of both worlds: Some programmed improvement of the workings of the market economy, and still those best things of life that aren’t measured in the gross national product—freedom to criticize, freedom to change, and freedom to do one’s own thing.”

    The U.S. private sector was a poor example of unbridled capitalism, with legal monopoly corporations imposing higher prices than a free market would deliver, and a system of government that allowed businesses, through expensive lobbying of Congress, to alter laws to improve their profitability. 13 Even Friedman’s trademark policy—insisting that the Federal Reserve provide a steady, slow increase in the supply of money to keep inflation low and predictable—acknowledged as appropriate the role of an unelected government body in creating economic stability.

    We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candor that that option no longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step. 6 Callaghan’s stark message was not heeded.

    The most successful democratic party in the Western world had triumphed from century to century because, like many British people, it was ignorant and distrustful of concepts and ideologies. “The dominant traits in the Conservative intellectual tradition, to be found in Halifax, Hume, Burke, Coleridge, Disraeli and Salisbury, are skepticism, a sense of the limitations of human reason, a rejection of abstraction or abstract doctrines, a distrust of systems and a belief instead in the importance of experience and of ‘circumstance,’ ” Gilmour wrote. “For Conservatives to embrace monetarism was contrary to all of them.”

    Heath took a less charitable view. He spoke for all Keynesians when he wrote: The Conservative Party had rightly criticized socialists for their attachment to doctrinal, impractical ideas. The purpose of politics is to bring benefit to one’s country, not to experiment with academic theories. Monetarism, the idea that inflation is a purely monetary phenomenon, the product of nothing more than an increase in the money supply, is perhaps the most deceptively simplistic of all economic theories. As such, it was always likely to be especially attractive to those whose understanding of economics was limited.

Thrift was a virtue and profligacy a vice.

    The best means of controlling the money supply, Friedman argued, was control of the “monetary base,” the purchase and sale of government bonds by the Bank of England to clearing banks. “Control of the monetary base should be exercised through open market operations primarily in short-term debt, which, with a single reserve asset, would no longer be close to a perfect substitute for base money,” he wrote. “The Bank should decide in advance each week how much to buy or sell, not the price at which it will buy or sell. It should permit interest rates to be determined entirely by the market.” The price of sterling, too, should not be maintained by government intervention but left to the free market. As for the inevitable economic downturn as money tightened, “Unemployment and excess capacity are an unfortunate side effect of reducing inflation, not a cure—just as staying in bed is a side effect of an appendicitis operation, not a cure for appendicitis.” What was causing the contraction? “The slowing of [public] spending in response to the slowing of monetary growth and the inevitable lags in the absorption of slower spending by wages and prices.” 38

    Greenspan explained: As officials whose entire careers had been devoted to fighting inflation, we found the experience of making such cuts decidedly strange. Yet the economy was clearly in the grip of disinflation, in which market forces combine to hold down wages and prices and cause inflation expectations, and hence long-term interest rates, to recede.

    The supply-side logic behind the tax cuts, to inspire entrepreneurs to work harder, was a myth. “Giving tax cuts to the Fortune 500 companies and their shamelessly overpaid executives is not going to make them suddenly dynamic,” 28 he said. He continued: The system of corporate governance that has allowed CEOs to earn 400 times the median wage of their employees—two decades ago it used to be 40—has undermined any case for tax cuts to the upper brackets. Corporate pay based on quarterly earnings instead of long-term growth, combined with golden parachutes even if executives fail, undermines productivity. Tax cuts for this group, then, is literally counterproductive.

    Like many younger Americans, Bernanke’s failure to grasp the full horror of the decade of unemployment during the slump had, in Samuelson’s view, caused him to play down the importance of unemployment when deciding Fed policy. Samuelson believed that short memories about the mass unemployment of the Thirties and the sacrifices made by ordinary Americans during World War II had made more tolerable the joblessness inherent in policies proposed by Friedman and others. “There has been a 1980–2003 swing to the right among voters, whose swing away from ‘altruism’ is somewhat proportional to the time elapsed since the Great Depression and since the U.S. government’s effective organization for World War II’s ‘good’ war,” 7 Samuelson explained.

    The origin of the financial freeze, according to Bernanke, 5 was the endless cheap credit that stemmed from the Federal Reserve’s decision after the shock of 9/ 11 to hold interest rates low to encourage business activity. The abundance of cheap money led to a housing boom in the U.S., fueled by a rapid expansion of mortgage lending, often to borrowers whose credit record would not in normal times have passed muster. Such was the rush to enroll new customers that mortgage companies waived cash deposits on properties and appeared to ignore whether the borrower could afford the loan repayments. In addition, the abandonment during the Clinton years of longstanding regulations on the banking sector—at the behest of Greenspan and Republican lawmakers—meant that bad practices among lenders and bundlers of bad debt went unchecked. As Bernanke explained, “Regulators did not do enough to prevent poor lending, in part because many of the worst loans were made by firms subject to little or no federal regulation.” 6 And financial companies deliberately made new investment products complex, hiding bad loans among good to ensure that the extent of the risk was hard for buyers of debt to sound out.

    That summer, it emerged that the giant mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which between them guaranteed more than half of America’s $ 12 trillion mortgages, were in serious trouble. As mortgage borrowers, watching the price of their properties plummet, began to default on repayments, Fannie and Freddie’s shares tumbled. The pair began hemorrhaging cash and in November 2007 Fannie posted losses of $ 1.4 billion and Freddie recorded a $ 2 billion loss.

    But the principle that the government should keep out of the way and let the market do its worst had been shaken to destruction. In the heat of the crisis, no respected economist could be found to argue that it would be better to watch the economy fall off a cliff and wait for the market to provide a solution. 18 Friedman’s perennial prescription, to give the market time to cure itself, was not found wanting; it wasn’t even considered. Events happened so quickly, there was no time. The cost to businesses and the human devastation of letting the chips fall was not thought a politically viable solution.

    While Samuelson conceded that the stimulus would likely lead to higher prices, he argued it was acceptable. “If, optimistically, we are back at 4 percent unemployment by 2012, the price level will be higher than it is today, probably rising at 2 percent a year, culminating in 8 percent,” he said. “I think that is worth it, because deflation is the greater worry. Given the circumstances, we should err on the side of over-stimulus. Nobody in their right mind would try to roll back that level of inflation if it avoids deflation and leaves us with an intact, self-sustaining economy again.” 19 Bernanke agreed, concluding that when the dust had settled and the economy had been made secure, the Fed could manage the inflationary pressures by slowly reducing the supply of money as soon as an upward swing in prices became evident.

    The Bank of Japan had duly adopted a policy of quantitative easing (QE), buying government securities and other financial assets on the open market. The effect was to increase the price of those securities and assets, thereby reducing the interest that they paid to investors. Bernanke also deployed QE, increasing the Fed’s pre–Great Recession holdings of $ 800 billion in Treasury notes to a peak of $ 2.1 trillion in June 2010. When in November 2010 this proved inadequate, the Fed launched a second round of security buying, known as QE2, followed by a third round, QE3, in November 2012. While some conservative economists questioned whether Friedman would have approved of quantitative easing, for Bernanke the lesson of Friedman’s Great Depression research was clear. The Fed chair was not going to be found guilty of starving the economy of funds.

    “What then is it that, since 2007, has caused Wall Street capitalism’s own suicide?” asked Samuelson the following year. “At the bottom of this worst financial mess in a century is this: Milton Friedman-Friedrich Hayek libertarian laissez-faire capitalism, permitted to run wild without regulation. This is the root source of today’s travails. Both of these men are dead, but their poisoned legacies live on.” 24 For Samuelson, the financial freeze and its cure were the ultimate vindication of a lifetime as “an incurable centrist.”

    Nonetheless, his singular achievement was to wrench the federal government away from attempting to manage the economy through fiscal measures. The Keynesian “New Economics” was beaten by stagflation and by Friedman. But successive Fed chiefs and Treasury secretaries complained that interest rates and monetary policy alone were insufficient instruments to juggle the price of the floating dollar, inflation, unemployment, and the rate of economic growth. Some of Friedman’s theoretical economics, such as his work on the consumption function, continues to be admired. But few have continued to hanker after Friedman’s flagship idea, doctrinaire monetarism, which is remembered, if remembered at all, as an arcane, otiose footnote in the history of economic thought.

    Friedman fared better in the success of his idiosyncratic policy recommendations. His plea to end punitive income taxes has largely been realized. In the three decades 1950–1980, the federal income tax rate had never dipped below 70 percent. By 2021, it had fallen to 40.8 percent. 51 Friedman could also claim a victory in the abolition of compulsory military service, though, after the horrors endured by those conscripted to fight the Vietnam War, the draft would likely have ended anyway. His attempt to wrest public education out of the hands of politicians proved partially successful, with the idea picked up by both sides of the political divide, from Bill Clinton to Margaret Thatcher, often in the shape of taxpayer-funded charter schools. But public schools remain overwhelmingly underfunded and

The Department of Energy, which Friedman wished to abolish, continues to operate. His advice to successive Republican presidents and congressmen to allow hard drugs like heroin and cocaine to be sold legally fell on deaf ears. An outsider all his life, Friedman remains an outsider in death. Friedman’s continuing influence on American politics, however, became evident in 2009 in the rise of the Tea Party, an anti–big government, anti-taxation, angry grassroots movement born of the Bush/ Obama/ Bernanke stimulus that purged the Republican Party of moderates and laid the foundations for the election of Donald Trump52 as president in 2016. Could there have been a President Trump without Friedman? Perhaps. But Friedman’s long libertarian march over several decades paved the way and helped deliver in Trump a president as wayward, self-serving, intellectually inconsistent, and focused solely on reelection as any since Nixon.
