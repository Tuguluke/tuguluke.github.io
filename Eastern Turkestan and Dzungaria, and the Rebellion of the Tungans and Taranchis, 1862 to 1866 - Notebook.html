It has been asserted in a Russian paper that the population of Eastern Turkestan is under-estimated at 20,000,000, but 20,000,000 of inhabitants placed within the entire area would give an average of 250 individuals to each square mile, and we must bear in mind that only the borders of the country have a settled population, the centre of it being desert, steppe, and waste land.* On ￼ authority, if it is to be at all considered, Mont.

But the district of Ho ten, with the town of Harasser, is alone said to contain a population of 3,000,000, although Dr. Morrison says only 44,630. The compilers of the Russian Military Statistical Review for 1868, basing their assumption on the most recent inquiries, estimate the entire population of Eastern Turkestan at "very probably 3,000,000."

    Eastern Turkestan is a geographical distinction of comparatively modern origin, dictated by the great physical barrier which, in the shape of the Pair upland, nature has placed longitudinally, between East and West, in Central Asia. Ethnographically, this physical line of limitation marks no distinction of race. One homogeneous family of Turks fills the whole of that zone from the extreme western limits of Asia to the borders of Western China. In the eastern division of Central Asia there may indeed be a perceptible difference in the national character of the Turks, but this comes from the interspersion of some heterogeneous elements among the dominant population.

But it will be seen that, after exterminating their late masters and effecting their own liberation by joining the successful rebels of the south, the people of Dzungaria finally separated themselves from their ￼ allies. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth century the whole of ￼ was under the rule of the Hods, the saintly descendants of Ma homed. The dissensions which occurred among them brought about a division of parties as well as constant bloodshed, and a general revolution. The result was the conquest of all ￼ by the ￼ of Dzungaria. But in 1756, Dzungaria was seized by the Chinese, and in 1758 the whole of Eastern Turkestan likewise succumbed to their authority. From that time, until 1864, Eastern Turkestan was known to us as Chinese Turkestan.

    But if on the north, west, and south the physical features of the country have, together with other circumstances, combined to prevent the world from acquiring a knowledge of what was transpiring within Dzungaria, it may not have been unreasonable to look to Peking for some light on a great crisis which more or less affected the interests of three empires. As no information has, however, been forthcoming from China, we must conclude that the Chinese authorities and garrisons in Dzungaria and Eastern Turkestan were either wholly exterminated, or that in the massacres not a single Celestial was spared who on his return could have been capable of rendering an account of events.

    As regards the Tongans, their appellation is supposed to be derived from the Turk word for remnant, applied to the late rebellious subjects of China because they were supposed to be the descendants of the Turks who followed Alexander of Macedon on his Eastern Expedition, and who remained to settle in the countries they had conquered.

According to Chinese history, there were two deportations, in one case of upwards of 800,000 families, and in another of more than 200,000. Doubtless, voluntary immigrations into China followed afterwards, but history contains no record of them. The immigrants, called Hoi-hoi-tsi, or Turks of Turkestan, were mainly settled in the province of Han-su, whence, in subsequent times, under the general designation of Han-hoi-tsi, or Chinese Turks, they gradually spread all over China, but principally over the northern provinces along the great wall, and over the provinces of the west, such as ￼ Szechuan, Yunnan, and ￼ where they came to be distinguished as Tun-Han-Su, that is, "the same as those of Han-su."

In 1862, the Tongans in China numbered 30,000,000 of people, spread over all the interior provinces of China, and preponderating greatly in Han-su. In Urumqi there were about 200,000 Tongans.

    It may at first sight seem strange that, with so large an army garrisoning the country, the Chinese should have been unable to retain it; it may appear stranger still, that after more than 100 years' tenure, their downfall in it should have been so sudden, so complete, and so ignominious. The reason is simple enough, and a summary of it will be found in the words of an Uzbek in Kashmir to a Russian Officer, in 1868: "Your law," he said, speaking of the restrictions put on Russians in Kashmir, "gives liberty to Uzbek in "your country; ours is intolerant of foreigners, because we see what has happened through the freedom "allowed us in Kashmir by the Chinese." It cannot be said that the Chinese tyrannized over their ￼ subjects or drove the population of Turkestan to rebellion by cruelty and persecution. The evidence points in quite another direction. They have lost their a new territories" irretrievably, and have suffered what threatens to be only the first of a series of the most terrible calamities to the Manchu r dynasty in China, through a neglect of the laws of precaution which they had prescribed for themselves at the outset, and through a fatal, easy-going and unsuspecting reliance on the stability of their rule. It must be said of them that they were not intolerant either of religion, of public opinion, or of the influence exercised over the populace by leading natives; and it must, we think, be added to their credit, that they were not exacting in their demands on the people. « They had shown themselves great adepts in the mode of subduing alien and barbarous races; they had an extensive acquaintance with the character and temper of the numerous peoples with whom conquests had brought them into contact; the long period during which they continued to retain their dominion proves their good tact and judicious policy, but unfortunately they unlearned their lesson, and in the secession of their ￼ subjects we must see the necessary consequence of a system of lethargic, fatuous Government, the result of an overweening pride and inflated self-assurance.

This sketch of the line he is pursuing appears to accord with a certain harmony that exists between his policy and that of the Russian Government.

He was received by Yakut-Bek on the very day of his arrival in Kashmir (19th (31st) of October)—a mark of either very particular favour, or of great anxiety on the part of Yakut to learn the purport of his mission, if we may judge by the assurance given to Prince ￼ in Koran (who was granted an audience on the third day after his arrival) that so prompt a reception was given him purely out of consideration for his high standing and for his friendship with the Governor General.
