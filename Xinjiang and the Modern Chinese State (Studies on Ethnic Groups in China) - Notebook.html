    Because the non-Han frontier evinced cultural, ethnic, economic, and political norms strikingly different from those in the Han heartland, “special conditions” (tebie qingxing) mandated adherence to a form of “loose rein” (jimi) governance imbued with the “spirit of accommodation” or “flexible arrangements” (biantong). 2

    In 1884, owing both to the Russian threat and to the brief rise and fall of an independent Islamic state in Xinjiang, the Qing court decided to consolidate its rule in the northwest by turning Xinjiang into a province (sheng), as distinct from its former designation as an outer dependency (shudi). In this new provincial bureaucracy, Han officials with civil service examination degrees began to replace the longstanding military aristocracy of Manchu and Mongol bannermen, who had once regarded all the non-Han peripheries of China as their unique political preserve. 3

    As the discourse of the nation-state increasingly lent itself to opportunistic application in the realm of geopolitics, Chinese elites quickly became aware of the ways in which discontent on their own non-Han borderlands could breed results drastically different from those engendered by discontent in the heartland. The last time Xinjiang had been wrenched from Beijing’s control, for about a decade in the 1860s and 1870s, Beijing’s political rivals in Central Asia could only produce a single slogan around which to rally the Turkic natives against Qing rule: holy war. 5 After the fall of the Manchus in 1911, the exclusionist discourse of the nation-state, premised on the novel ideal of ethnic self-rule, provided a new platform from which rival political

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 5 · Location 192

<div class="noteText">
    elites could challenge Chinese rule. Yang Zengxin, governor of Xinjiang for seventeen years after the 1911 revolution, made clear what was liable to happen if China proved unable to keep the foreigners at bay. “Let us imagine,” he wrote to Beijing in 1917, “that trouble was to break out in the southwestern provinces today. Eventually they would be reunified. But if there is even the slightest slip in Xinjiang, so important for national defense, it will fall under the control of a foreign power. Even if we then had an eternity, we would not be able to recover it.” 6

    In the twentieth-century political history of Xinjiang, the only majority non-Han provincial-level unit of China never to have slipped from the hands of Han officials, we find the most complete case study for an interrogation of the legacy and inheritance of empire in the eastern Eurasian mainland after 1911. “Strategies of difference” consistently marked Xinjiang as a unique part of the Chinese state, a place where the normal rules of political discourse in the Han heartland ceased to apply. An extended analysis of what Han officials said and did in Xinjiang—as opposed to what Han intellectuals or politicians on the eastern seaboard merely said about Xinjiang—will thus bring us close to an understanding of the imperial foundation upon which modern Chinese

    Yang occasionally voiced his hope that “two or three great and powerful men will rouse their consciences, get rid of predatory armies, and implement policies beneficial to the people.” He did not, however, expect that any such savior would come from the non-Han borderlands. As governor of Xinjiang, Yang’s job was to sit tight and “wait for the day when the central plains have calmed down.” In the meantime, he wrote in 1919, “if I am able to maintain one portion [of the country], and the [central] government is able to maintain another, is this not for the best?” 8

<div class="noteText">
    Han officials in the heartland, though obliged to strive for the impossible goal of national salvation—and then watch as the inevitable denouement sapped the morale of all but their most ardent enthusiasts—generally did not have to worry about hostile charges of Chinese “colonialism” or “imperialism.” Run-of-the-mill “autocrats” and “despots” they might be, but at least they were not characterized as chauvinist Han nationalists who “hated” their culturally alien subjects, as Russians officials once alleged of Yang. Viewed from this perspective, it should come as no surprise that Yang went to extraordinary lengths to select and publish for public consumption only those telegrams showing his manipulation of the politics of difference, while omitting entirely the hostile versions put forth by his many rivals.

    Thus, the contest for wealth and power in twentieth-century Xinjiang—and by extension, the rest of the non-Han periphery—was mediated both in name and in deed through the strategic manipulation of difference. That there was still such difference to exploit underscores the growing realization among scholars that the twentieth century in no way marked the transition from “empire to nation-state,” in China or elsewhere.

    My analysis suggests that the phrase national empire—related to but distinct from the idea of the Soviet Union as an “empire of nations”—appears to be the most suitable label. 14 Even some late Qing intellectuals coined a strikingly similar phrase—minzu diguo—in Chinese.

    and studies of the Ottoman, Russian, French, and other empires throughout history have all deemed the flexible institutionalization of ethnic and spatial difference as a defining characteristic of the largest and most enduring multiethnic states. In its most condensed form, the “politics of difference” is little more than the presumption “that different peoples within the polity will be governed differently” and that “distinction and hierarchy”—or the “non-equivalence of multiple populations”—will be maintained even as the state incorporates new people. 16 Key to this interpretation is the distinction between empire as a type of state and empire as a type of power.

<div class="noteText">
    From this enduring paradigm, scholars and pundits have coined the phrase divide and rule, a concept usually imagined as the guiding ideology of a Machiavellian imperial elite. The idea of empire as a type of state, however, derives much of its explanatory power from scholarship conducted over the past several decades on the major Eurasian land-based empires:

<div class="noteText">
    Historians of China, however, have generally stopped short of adapting such insights toward the twentieth-century successor states of the Qing. In tracing this Eurasian legacy of political difference into the twentieth century, Soviet historians have done the most to complicate the enduring paradigm of empire as a type of power. In demonstrating how the Soviet state was more a “maker of nations” than a “breaker of nations,” they have provided historians of modern China with the analytical tools necessary to reconsider the imperial legacy bequeathed to twentieth-century Republican and Communist administrators along the non-Han borderlands. 17 This in turn enables us to interrogate the ways modern China—as a type of state—still resembled its imperial predecessors.

    Because modern China is often portrayed first and foremost as a victim of Western and Japanese imperialism (both in the narratives of its own political elites and in those of foreigners), historians have been slow to recognize that not every significant region of ethnocultural difference managed to slip from Chinese control after 1911.

    Owen Lattimore recognized as much during his travels along the northern borderlands in the 1920s, noting that “while the Chinese could rightly claim that they suffered from foreign imperialism, there was also a second level of Chinese imperialism against the Mongols.” 20 The words and deeds of Han officials resident in Xinjiang constitute the missing link necessary to portray twentieth-century China first and foremost as an empire among empires, and later as a nationalizing empire among nationalizing empires.

    In 1909, Liankui, the Manchu governor-general for both Gansu and Xinjiang and Yang’s superior at the time, was tasked with overseeing provincial elections and the formation of a parliament for Xinjiang. After noting the miniscule proportion of Han in his province and the almost total lack of educated Han gentry, Liankui proceeded to regale the central government with his extensive knowledge of ethnopolitics in other contemporary empires.

    Though political elites throughout China were closely attuned to strategies of difference practiced in the British, French, and Japanese empires, those practiced in the Russian empire would ultimately determine the geopolitical and ethnocultural configurations on display in today’s People’s Republic. Due to Russia’s geographical proximity, superior military technology, transportation networks, and economic resources, Han officials posted along the northern and western borderlands ignored their neighbor at their own peril. In fact, more often than not, whenever Han rulers saw fit to import Russian political innovations into their own non-Han jurisdictions, they did so as part of a defensive strategy designed to counterbalance an offensive version of the same tactic first introduced by the Russians.

    the driving force behind such demarcations was the “northern hybrid state.” These political entities combined the military advantages of an Inner Asian conquest elite with the cultural, economic, and administrative resources of the Han heartland.

    Whenever pastoral peoples from the “northern zone” managed to incorporate the sedentary agricultural communities of the south into their state, however, they continued to treat the Han heartland as a distinct economic, cultural, religious, and political unit. While the “inner provinces” (neisheng) were intended to provide most of the wealth, labor, administrative knowledge, and cultural resources necessary to run a massive empire, Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria, and Xinjiang were chiefly envisioned as strategic bulwarks unique to the geopolitical concerns of an Inner Asian conquest dynasty.

    From 1915 to 1921, the governor, aided by geopolitical crises occasioned by the Russian civil war, successfully lobbied for the abolition of the Ili general, Tarbagatai councilor, and Altay minister. In fact, the present-day borders of Xinjiang are largely a result of Yang’s efforts to create an administratively homogenous provincial unit free from internal challenges to his rule.

    Regarding as a mistake the designation of Xinjiang as a province in 1884, Yang moved to restore a foundation of institutionalized difference in Xinjiang, which he regarded as a land distinct from the inner provinces.

    In effect, he was recreating the principles of territorial accommodation once prevalent in Xinjiang prior to the last decades of the Qing, complete with a new occupational caste modeled on the Inner Asian conquest elite once assigned sole responsibility for the non-Han borderlands. These men were Han officials who had spent most, if not all, of their careers in the northwest.

    Otherwise, as he was fond of telling anyone who would listen, it just might become “the next Outer Mongolia.” In 1955, the Chinese Communists, in repudiating Xinjiang’s provincial status and designating it the Uighur Autonomous Region—effectively restoring the early Qing distinction between “inner” and “outer” domains—gave formal sanction to what Yang had long acknowledged in practice.

    Closely associated with the aforementioned structures of territorial accommodation, dependent intermediaries generally belonged to one of four categories: indigenous elites from a conquered society (e.g., the Muslim princes of Xinjiang); members of the ruling caste intentionally displaced from their homeland (e.g., Manchu, Mongol, and Han bannermen); learned members of a previously marginal group who improved their lot by serving the new power (e.g., Jews, Armenians, Germans, Tatars, and Jesuits); and members of a stigmatized group suddenly placed in a position of authority (e.g., slaves and eunuchs).

    In fact, until the late nineteenth century, the only post a successful Han graduate of the civil service examination system could hope to obtain was one located within the inner provinces. Mongols and Manchus, however, could serve in both the heartland and the non-Han borderlands. Thus, when Wang Shunan and Yang Zengxin were transferred to Xinjiang in 1906 and 1907, respectively, both were representatives of the first generation of Han officials to govern the non-Han borderlands in over a thousand years, all the way back to the Tang dynasty. Yet they quickly learned the tools of the trade. During the four decades of the republic in Xinjiang, Chinese governors would make full use of Tatar expatriates, Manchu bannermen (the Solon and Sibe), White Russian soldiers, the Muslim prince of Hami, Mongol and Kazak princes and chiefs, Turkic begs, and Hui (Chinese-speaking Muslims) soldiers.

    When Shah Maqsut, the Muslim prince of Hami, attempted to break free of such constraints, he met with stiff resistance from Governor Yang. In 1914, the prince requested permission to make his scheduled pilgrimage to Beijing via the Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia, bypassing the costly and time-consuming camel paths through inner China. Yang begged the republican administration in Beijing not to set what he considered to be a dangerous precedent. “If the prince enters Beijing through Russia and traverses thousands of miles in a foreign land,” he wrote, “he will see with his own eyes the material prosperity and superior transportation of the outside world…. It will then be very difficult for us to prevent him from becoming

    In fact, we might say that, after 1911, the greatest threat to a successful reorientation of non-Han loyalties to an inner Chinese metropole lay in the widespread fear that the strident rhetoric of revolutionary Han nationalists might one day be translated into equally intolerant institutions of chauvinist Han rule. During the twentieth century, such fears were embodied via the widespread perception of a normative alignment of “nation” and “state.” Both the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China chose to harness the Sinic compound zhonghua (lit. “central florescence”) to represent the “China” of their official state names. Derived from the shifting and vague cognates of zhongguo (“ the central states” or “central plains,” i.e., “China”) and huaxia (the “florescent and grand” community of civilized people), Zhonghua is the ostensible embodiment of the ideals of enlightened inclusion, not xenophobic exclusion.

    To one degree or another, each successive administration to occupy the Chinese metropole would attempt to defuse hostile charges of “Han chauvinism”—the kryptonite of any cosmopolitan civil discourse—by engaging in highly visible theatrics involving the public scapegoating of a Han villain associated with Xinjiang. Though such scapegoats were preferably Han men buried safely in the distant past, the most desperate administrations were willing to skewer anyone. Thus in the 1930s, the Nationalist government, shut out of Xinjiang entirely, pounced on the opportunity to arraign fleeing Han governor Jin Shuren on formal charges of exploiting and otherwise oppressing the non-Han peoples of Xinjiang. The trial, covered widely in the media and associated with expatriate Uighur intellectuals operating under Nanjing’s umbrella, gave the Nationalists a stage on which to advertise their ethnopolitical enlightenment with respect to the non-Han borderlands.

    Yang’s official explanation was that they did “not possess knowledge or experience with regard to military service.” Though this was largely true, it was mostly a by-product of the Qing’s long-standing reluctance to arm their non-Han Muslim subjects rather than due to any innate characteristics of the Uighurs as a people.

    Aside from these elite but seldom-used Han units, Yang also kept a tatterdemalion throng of Han toughs drawn from what he referred to as the opium-smoking vagrant population. Numerous foreigners commented on their disheveled and miserable appearance. By all accounts, the units to which this Han rabble were assigned appear to have functioned as little more than a holding ground for social undesirables that Yang wished to keep off the streets. They seem rarely, if ever, to have been ordered into action, and it is difficult to imagine that the native populace took them as a credible threat. More often than not, they were mocked and lampooned as dregs of the Han race whom the governor thought best to place under organized watch rather than let them roam free through the non-Han streets of Xinjiang.

    The integrationist policies of the late Qing exacerbated this problem by promoting the “reclamation” of “wastelands” in the decades following Zuo Zongtang’s reconquest of the region. By the time Yang Zengxin became governor, such migrants had become a threat to the stability of the province. “Over the past several decades,” he lamented in 1914, “Xinjiang has become the colony [zhimindi] of the inner provinces.” The following year the governor implored Beijing to stop sponsoring such aggressive policies. “What good can come from sending more vagrants beyond the pass?” he asked. “They bring with them nothing but trouble.”

    When his successor sparked a massive civil war interpreted by many of its participants as a war of the races, however, aspiring Han rulers of Xinjiang could no longer champion the existing order, nor could they look to the discredited past for models of narrative legitimacy. As a result, conditions were ripe for a major overhaul of existing ideological paradigms. The twelve-year tenure (1933–44) of Han warlord Sheng Shicai, a man with no experience whatsoever in the non-Han borderlands, witnessed the first steps toward importing a narrative of legitimacy first designed in the Soviet Union.

    Informed that Russian authorities had no intention of sparing the remaining 300,000 Kazak and Kyrgyz refugees from a similar fate, Yang Zengxin reflected on the depths to which the Russian state had suddenly plunged. “The mountains are littered with corpses,” he wrote. “Russia is supposed to be a great civilized country, with respect for human life. How can they let this happen?” 4 The answer to the governor’s question was to be found in the shivering bodies of innocent bystanders, snatched as strategic collateral by fleeing nomads. “When the Kyrgyz fled from Russia,” Yang later learned, “they took with them a countless number of white-skinned women and children as hostages. These women and children are now howling from starvation and cold in the passes, their plaintive cries for help unanswered.” Before long, Russians armed with machine guns and bayonets were streaming over the border at will, in frantic search of wives and children, descriptions of whom were posted as “missing persons” signs throughout the province.

    Outside the provincial capital of Urumchi, the governor’s political authority was severely circumscribed. Among those regions of Xinjiang still retaining their own military units and the right of direct communication with Beijing were the Altay minister (zhangguan), Tarbagatai councilor (canzan), Ili general (jiangjun), and Kashgar commander (titai). As any glimpse at a map of contemporary Xinjiang will show, the jurisdictions of these four semiautonomous offices were all situated in strategic regions sharing a border with the Russian empire.

    “Calls to throw off the foreign yoke grow stronger day by day,” he wrote in 1920, assessing global politics. “Whether in China or elsewhere, everybody now harbors such thoughts.” To Yang, the implications of such trends were clear and disturbing. “The Turban people are gradually gaining more knowledge about the world. In the future, there is little doubt that those in Russian Turkestan … will drive out the Slavic race of Russians, and restore their own Khoqand Khanate.”

    In 1920–21, Yang’s worst fears came to pass. First came General Andrei Bakich (1878–1922), a Montenegrin Serb who made camp at Tacheng with eight thousand soldiers and another five thousand refugees in tow. One month later, Cossack Ataman Boris Annenkov (1889–1927) followed him into the Ili valley, still commanding a force of about one thousand battle-tested troops. Through equal parts diplomacy, subterfuge, and military coercion, Yang managed to imprison Annenkov and his men in the desert wastes of Dunhuang, where they proceeded to deface ancient murals in the Thousand-Buddha Caves. Bakich, however, heartened by the arrival of one General Novikov and his men in Tacheng, began to prepare for a counterattack on Red positions just over the border. In May 1921, the Reds delivered an ultimatum to Yang outlining the consequences in store for him should he continue to harbor an enemy combatant in Chinese territory. The governor, unable to call on Beijing’s support or confront a militarily superior Russian foe, informed the daoyin of Tacheng that “[ I] must row my boat with the current.” Heaven, he declared, “has presented us with an opportunity to destroy the Whites by borrowing the strength of the Reds. We cannot go against the will of Heaven.”

    What Governor Yang was attempting to describe has been the subject of much research by Soviet historians over the past two decades. One scholar characterizes the Soviet transformation of its non-Russian borderlands as “a strategy aimed at disarming nationalism by granting what were called the ‘forms’ of nationhood.” In other words, it was a preemptive strike against the ideal of national determination, an attempt to make nationalism work for the empire, not against it. In much the same way as a vaccine protects its host from a fatal disease by injecting a less potent version of the same disease into the bloodstream, Soviet policymakers similarly “midwifed” silhouette versions of

    Before long, Yang found that the Mongols were expanding their irredentist claims beyond the Altay region, declaring, on the basis of historical demographics, that Ili, Tacheng, and even Urumchi should also “return” to the Mongol embrace. “Ever since the Outer Mongols began to receive Soviet financial and military backing,” Yang lamented, “their ambition knows no bounds.”

    For Yang and other Han officials educated during the imperial era, the very idea of national determination represented a perversion of the natural social order. Though all Chinese officials were exhorted to “love” or otherwise “cherish” the common people, there was to be no question of who was in charge. In 1913, Yang Zuanxu, a Han general sympathetic to the revolutionary movement, told the Muslims of Kashgar that “the age of ignorance has ended” and anyone could now aspire to become governor of the province. 40 In response, Yang Zengxin shut down the “new method” Muslim schools of Kashgar and arranged for Yang Zuanxu’s transfer out of the province. He was fortunate to leave Xinjiang with his life, a luxury not accorded some of his allies.

    Though it is still unclear precisely to what degree they managed to uphold this promise during the time Yang was in office, at least in principle, the Soviets do appear to have been committed to this end. That is, while the Turkic expatriates of Xinjiang could expect sympathetic treatment and perhaps even an “autonomous” Uighur political unit of their own while living within the boundaries of Soviet Central Asia, they could not expect Soviet sponsorship of a Uighur nationalist platform to accompany the return of expatriates to Xinjiang. 45 In other words, the moment Soviet affirmative action threatened to make the leap from domestic to international policy, Moscow’s geopolitical interests would ultimately determine whether that leap would be made. In the final analysis, pragmatism trumped ideology.

    The governor’s suspicions appeared to be vindicated. “More than half of these men,” Yang wrote, referring to the thousands of itinerant Turkic laborers who crossed the border in search of seasonal work each year, “are involved in hard labor. They are an uneducated floating population, and are extremely susceptible to instigation by foreigners.” 52 Convinced of expatriate radicalization abroad, Zhao’s first cable from Semipalatinsk advised Xinjiang’s local officials “to conduct thorough background checks on any future military conscripts, so as to avoid allowing any man who has performed seasonal hard labor abroad from filling our ranks.”

    Alarmed at seeing the tools of imperial competition turned back against themselves, the Soviets hatched a plan to eliminate the Chinese expatriate community altogether, in order to deprive Xinjiang’s five consulates of their raison d’être.

In 1927, with the establishment of a new Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek, warlords like Feng scrambled to shore up their defenses against the newly acknowledged central government in Nanjing. Feng needed an additional rearguard base from which to engage the Nationalists, and Xinjiang had long fit his geopolitical criteria for such a base. 65 By 1928, it had become widely known that Yang was about to retire. “I’ve worked my ‘stratagem of the empty citadel’ [kongcheng ji] in Xinjiang for seventeen years now,” Yang told a visitor in 1928, referring to an ancient strategy for deterring enemies through the art of illusion.

Just one year later, the army had again doubled in size, with 74 percent of the provincial budget allotted to the military. To facilitate movement of soldiers throughout the province, along with a reliable communication network, Jin poured money into road construction and telephony services, with several steamrollers imported from—and a handful of students exported to—Germany. Most importantly, Jin undertook to finance, in fits and starts, a pair of massive arms shipments from British India and the Soviet Union.

Xie noted how the Turkic peasants of Hami, hearing of the abolition of the Muslim khanates in Shanshan and Turfan during the late Qing, “twice circled the city walls to protest the corvée obligations imposed upon them by the Muslim prince, and demanded to be placed under the jurisdiction of Han officials.” Xie thought it a “pity” that Yang refused to accede to their request. Two years later Lin Jing described much the same situation, adding further details about how Yang resisted the demands of both his own local Han officials and the Turkic peasants in Hami for the abolition of Shah Maqsut’s prerogatives. 80 Yang not only refused to impinge on Shah Maqsut’s prerogatives, but even went so far as to aid him in brutal suppression campaigns, all the while continuing to claim the prince as a Muslim ally of the Chinese state.

    To fully understand this dramatic turn of events, let us take a look at a page from the Chinese customs ledger at Nilka Pass for a single winter’s morning in early 1934, drawn at random from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Archives in Urumchi: A convoy arrived at 10: 30 a.m., with 9 vehicles, 18 drivers (lead driver named Qurban), 625 blocks of tin (27,500 pounds), 164 rounds of ammunition, 272 empty iron canisters, and 7 empty wooden canisters. Released at 11: 30 a.m. At 11: 30 a.m. another convoy arrived, with 57 vehicles and 103 drivers (en route to Xingxing Gorge), 640 barrels of oil (97,428 kilograms, 53,466 kilograms less than before), 11 rifles, 36 “seven star” revolvers, 8 turtle guns, 1,100 bullets, and 56 Soviet commercial representatives. 7 The resources described on this ledger represent only a piddling fraction of the enormous amount of industrial and war matériel that Sheng had managed to procure from the Soviet Union against the credit of his duban office.

    In 1921, when White Russian general Andrei Bakich occupied the Altay region and Turkic expatriate laborers in Andijan were openly calling for an attack on Ma Fuxing in Kashgar, the Soviet Politburo broached the idea of creating two separate states in Xinjiang: the Republics of Kashgar and Jungaria, to be set up in the southern and northern parts of the province. They would be modeled on the national republics then being molded throughout Soviet Central Asia. Lenin overruled the proposal, sparking a decade-long debate with the Comintern regarding Moscow’s proper stance toward the revolutionary potential of “subjugated” peoples the world over. The Comintern viewed the Chinese administrators in Xinjiang as purveyors of a “greedy and barbarous colonization” and described its Han rulers as “slavemasters.” 8 As a result, in 1931, all eyes were on the uprising in Hami. The Comintern saw in the movement led by Khoja Niyaz and Yolbars the “characteristics of a national liberation movement” and urged dispatching Soviet-trained Turkic expatriates into Xinjiang to help direct its course. “We must resolutely oppose any platform that provides assistance to the Chinese authorities in their suppression of the uprising.” 9 Stalin vetoed the Comintern proposal. Instead, on June 23, 1932, the Politburo decided to approve sales of US $ 200,705 worth of munitions to Governor Jin Shuren for use against the rebels,

    This they certainly professed. But profession is several steps short of implementation. The problem is that Soviet nationality policies were designed for exclusive use within the sovereign borders of the Soviet Union and its socialist satellites. In other words, Uighur expatriates living within Soviet Central Asia had every right to expect the creation of a Uighur autonomous entity of some sort, whether as a region, a county, or some other such administrative unit, lodged within the boundaries of a much larger national republic (such as Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan) under Soviet control. For people resident in Xinjiang yet envious of the ostensible political autonomy conferred upon their transnational brethren, however, Comintern blueprints for national liberation movements could not compete with Soviet realpolitik.

    If the Nationalists wanted to challenge the Soviet grip on Sheng Shicai and Xinjiang, they would need to do a lot more than simply talk like the Soviets. They would need to act like the Soviets, too. In practice, this meant taking under their wing prominent Uighur intellectuals from Xinjiang who were willing to broadcast the language of ethnopopulism on behalf of their Nationalist sponsors.

    Documents dating from 1935 to 1937 reveal at least eight references to Ma and whether he should be “released” back into Xinjiang. These discussions reached a climax in the summer of 1937, when the Politburo announced that “the Soviet government is ready to permit the departure of Ma Zhu-ying” upon the condition that Ma Hushan lay down his arms and agree to work within the new Sheng-led order. Instead, Ma Hushan’s decision to renew hostilities with Sheng soon thereafter likely sealed Ma Zhongying’s fate, especially if he was suspected of playing a role in Ma Hushan’s return to the battlefield. Following a terse Politburo decree of July 29, 1937 (“ Do not release Machuin [Ma Zhongying]”), his name does not surface in the archives again.

    In adapting Soviet nationality policies for Xinjiang, Sheng eschewed one long-standing condition: that every nationality be institutionally tethered to a physical plot of land bearing its name. In omitting this cherished stipulation of Stalin’s, Sheng hewed closer to what was known as the Austro-Marxist line than the Bolshevik line. Thus, unlike the Soviets before him and the Chinese Communists after him, Sheng made no attempt to establish “autonomous” regions, counties, or other such administrative units in Xinjiang, and certainly not in the name of the Kazaks, Kyrgyz, Uighurs, or Tajiks.

    Though estimates vary, a veteran of Sheng’s security force later put the number of executions in Urumchi at 14,000. As this does not include the many more people who were imprisoned but later released or anyone outside the capital, we can probably concur with the assessment of another former official, Guang Lu, that the total number of people jailed during Sheng’s tenure as duban was likely close to 80,000—in other words, 2 to 3 percent of the population of Xinjiang. 44 So many people were thrown into prison on trumped-up charges that visitors to elementary schools in Urumchi began to comment on the striking prevalence of female teachers. Half the students said they had no father at home. In 1944, with Sheng’s departure, his Nationalist successor was inundated with twenty to thirty petitions per day from relatives of the duban’s victims.

The wartime economy of Europe had altered Moscow’s priorities in Xinjiang. No longer did the Soviets demand only cotton, sheep, leather, silk, and oil from Sheng. Now they wanted the building blocks of industrial war munitions: tin, aluminum, copper, gold, silver, wolfram, and beryllium.

    It should therefore not surprise us in the least to learn that Chiang Kai-shek, far from begrudging the duban his decade of estrangement from the central government, instead took great pains to enshrine a legacy for Sheng far more positive than that accorded to Jin Shuren. In 1945, when Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Masud Sabri attempted to use the Sixth Party Congress to treat Sheng in much the same manner as they had Jin a decade earlier, the Generalissimo would have none of it. “Yesterday one of our colleagues accused Comrade Sheng of wanton mass murder during his time in Xinjiang,” Chiang announced. “Yet the fact that Comrade Sheng was eventually able to use his talents to deliver Xinjiang back to the central government is a contribution to both nation and party. Everyone here needs to understand this. Let us look at the larger picture, and stop fixating on culpability for the past.”

He added, however, that any uprising in Kashgar “must allow the participation of the Muslim clerical establishment; otherwise we will not be able to develop the struggle for national liberation.” Since a movement united by nothing more than religion could turn just as easily against the Soviets as against the Han, Kashgar was promptly removed from the list. The consul in Ili submitted a much more positive report, drawing attention to the sizable community of Soviet-educated intellectuals living in the area. Promoted to office during the early days of Sheng’s reign but now thoroughly embittered at their expulsion from government, these men would serve to offset the influence of Muslim clerics, who were viewed as key but unpredictable allies.

    In April 1945, two months after Ali Han Tore became a household name in Nationalist circles, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Generalissimo’s Soviet-educated son and minister of education, stopped in Urumchi on his way to Moscow. Governor Wu played the role of host. “He suggested that we might now adopt the idea of some of our comrades in other clans, and try to appoint some of their talented people to government positions,” Wu noted in his diary, adhering to the official party line of “clans” (zongzu) and “tribes” (buluo) rather than “ethnicities” (minzu). Ching-kuo also recommended “placing representatives from other clans as heads of government bureaus, with a Han occupying a secondary post.” Eventually, he told Wu, the Nationalists might even consider appointing someone from another “clan” as deputy governor of the province.

    “They can return anytime,” Wu replied. “But they harbor incorrect ‘East Turkestan’ thoughts. We must first rectify this shortcoming.” In the notations following this incident in his diary, later to be crossed out, Wu vented his frustration. “Whenever border figures are treated too generously during their time in the central government, I fail to see any good come out of it. Quite the contrary, they bring nothing but trouble to the state.” 42 Wu could scarcely believe his ears. Perhaps with an eye toward posthumous vindication, the governor took great care in his diary to record the “absurd proposals” of his Uighur colleagues, all of which were sure to “sabotage national unity”: that Xinjiang be renamed East Turkestan; that the people of Xinjiang govern Xinjiang; that the central government not be permitted to station troops in, or sponsor migration to, Xinjiang; and that the various nationalities of Xinjiang all be considered part of the Turkic—not Chinese—race.

    Try as he might, Wu never understood just how Zhang’s team of Uighur ethnopopulists was supposed to benefit the situation in Xinjiang. “If the talks [with the Ili representatives] proceed smoothly,” Wu learned after their arrival, “then we will not let Masud and company meet with the bandit representatives. If the talks experience difficulties, however, then we can consider using them as intermediaries.”

    For how could anyone accuse the Nationalists of Han chauvinism when they sponsored and condoned the sinophobic activities of Uighur dissidents operating within their own party? John Hall Paxton, the American consul in Urumchi, was one of those impressed by Nationalist demonstrations of ethnopolitical tolerance in Xinjiang. In a confidential report dated November 20, 1947, and entitled “Charges by Secretary General Aisabek [Isa Yusuf Alptekin] of Chinese Oppression of the Natives of Sinkiang,” Paxton highlighted the remarkable way the Chinese administration suffered “a considerable party … among the Muslim natives that is restless under Chinese control, critical of its abuses and eager for increased liberties for the native inhabitants of the area, without any reason to suppose that it is under Soviet influence.”

    In 1946, he assured Zhang that “our national liberation movement is not directed at any particular ethnic group, but only at that group’s ruling class and its authoritarian government.” These mild statements were worlds apart from the fire-and-brimstone pronouncements of Ali Han Tore.

    But the Soviets wanted native non-Han leaders indebted to themselves. Self-made men who had facilitated much of their own rise could not be reined in easily once strategic objectives were met or altered, as had been the case with Ali Han Tore.

    “Masud is a highly virtuous gentleman, who enjoys a senior position of authority among the Uighurs,” wrote an anonymous journalist in China News. “But in truth, even though Masud has ascended to the governorship, he wields very little real power.” Assuring his Han audience that Zhang, “the real power behind the throne,” was still in command, the author characterized Masud as Zhang’s “ace card.” 78 The political calculus on display here is almost identical to that of the Nationalist report on Soviet affirmative action six years earlier, with which this chapter opened.

    As a result, Ahmetjan decided to expose the Nationalist plot for what it really was. “To those who do not understand how the colonialists operate, here is what they do. They say: ‘We have given you a leader from among your own people.’ They say this to attract people to their side

    Like the Soviets, the Nationalists had little intrinsic interest in fostering non-Han agency for its own sake. The goal was simply to stop the rhetorical bleeding of the Chinese body politic begat by the Ili rebellion and little more. Judged by that standard, by late 1947 the Nationalists had met the Soviet test in Xinjiang.

    With Ahmetjan Qasimi president of the East Turkestan Republic and Delilhan in nominal control of its armies, Moscow had placed “proletarian” Uighurs and Kazaks at the top of a “national” republic, thus violating its own taboo against replicating the principles of affirmative action outside the borders of the Soviet Union and its satellites.

    In the back-and-forth struggle to construct and deconstruct narratives of Han political legitimacy in Xinjiang, both the Nationalists and the Soviets had finally exhausted their capacity for innovation. Everyone knew where the script of national determination was supposed to go from here. For fifteen years, the people of Xinjiang had been promised an ever greater share of the ethnopolitical pie. These mostly hollow pledges nevertheless gave rise to a very real logic of rising expectations, one with a momentum all its own. Therefore, if independence for the non-Han peoples of Xinjiang was not in the offing—and it most certainly was not—then some sort of surrogate compensation must be found. In the event, it would fall to the Chinese Communists to determine just what sort of compensation would be offered.

    IN OCTOBER 1949, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CHINESE Communist Party received a report from Deng Liqun, a special agent sent to infiltrate the Ili valley two months prior. “Some of the young people out here,” Deng wrote, “are wondering why the new Chinese leadership is not adopting the Marxist-Leninist principles of national determination as a means to national liberation.” Instead, “they say we are merely implementing regional autonomy. How do I respond to such queries?”
