They blame the bosses who mandate the system, the ones who laugh at their misery. And they hold the designers and engineers who created the technologies responsible.

According to some estimates, the Chinese security technology industry as a whole reached close to $ 100 billion, with more than 50 percent of the industry focused on domestic security engineering projects. In Xinjiang, the state awarded an estimated $ 65 billion in private contracts to build infrastructure and $ 160 billion more to government entities in the region—an increase of 50 percent from 2016. This new investment made it one of the largest receivers of state capital in the country.

It turned the convenience of smartphones into a disaster. In the control society of a Safe City, life is made predictable by maintaining relations of power at a technical remove. It does something more than this too. When the technology begins to think for people, it starts to normalize its power over life.

    In his consideration of Fanon’s decolonial framework in the context of colonial India, Homi Bhabha examines the way colonial powers develop intricate strategies of domination. He found that a class of interpreters was essential to such systems. In the logic of such systems, the class of interpreters who moved between the colonized subaltern and the colonial officials would adopt the forms of cultural distinction and values of the colonizer. Yet, as Bhabha shows, the hybrid figure of the interpreter is never able to fully inhabit this role. Instead, the interpreter remains an ambivalent figure. As permitted versions of otherness, they produce what Bhabha refers to as an always “partial vision of the colonizer’s presence.” Because of the ethno-racial trace that remains, these interpreters are destined to

    In Uyghur and Kazakh conceptualizations of halal standards, animals that are being prepared for slaughter should not witness the death of other animals while they wait their turn. Instead, after a quick prayer of blessing, the death should be swift and unexpected, a quick slice of the throat. Adilbek felt as though this was how his neighbors prepared him for life behind “the black gate,” a euphemism frequently used by Uyghurs and Kazakhs to refer to the camps. They did not want him to know what would come next. Maybe this was because they thought it would be easier to handle him this way. Maybe it was because they cared about him and wanted his social death to be swift.

Over and over they were told and shown that they were animals and that their survival depended on the whims of the guards.

On a state-authorized visit to a camp in 2019, a North American reporter furtively snapped an image of an Uyghur inscription etched into the wall of a cell. It read, “This dorm room is an outstanding dorm room. Hang in there my heart.” Many of the former detainees I interviewed said that one of the most difficult aspects of being in the camp was not knowing when, if ever, they might be released. The lack of control over bodily movements, speech, hunger, and sickness wore their bodies down physically and mentally. It made them distant from their loved ones outside the camp. Time began to center around staying alive by saying and doing what they were asked to do.

    What is often left unsaid in state-approved documents is the way these factory spaces function as an archipelago of near total institutions at the periphery of the Chinese social contract—an implicit agreement that a state will protect its citizens in exchange for their loyalty. For Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Hui citizens from Xinjiang, this social contract has been shattered as the prison archipelago is turned toward a mode of colonial-capitalist production—a reeducation labor regime—that eats into the vitality of their social reproduction.

    The introduction of state-directed, Han-exclusive corporate power over Uyghur and Kazakh life has the effect of accelerating the alienating effects of factory labor across ethnic and class differences. Alienation, removing the individual from the ownership of their labor as workers and, in this case, from their autonomy as Turkic Muslim individuals, is in fact a primary feature of the reeducation factory. By turning a population of people regarded as not deserving of legal protections into a permanent underclass, state authorities and private industrialists hope that they will extend the market expansion of the Chinese textile and garment industry. They are building a colonial frontier in capitalist accumulation. This system of controlled labor is “carried” forward by a massive reeducation system, a mechanism of infrastructural state power that ensures that this

In fact, because of this extralegal system, the only thing that protects Turkic Muslim workers from expropriation and violence is the goodwill of their Han managers. As indicated by the payment scheme at the glove factory, worker protections often appear to center on management “investment” in the quality of Turkic workers even while worker well-being and social relationships are viewed as valueless.
