    Introduction: How Did Development Actually Happen?
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 213
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    All wealthy capitalist economies feature institutions of good governance, such as protection of private property rights, professional bureaucracies, modern courts, formal accountability, and pluralistic participation, which all seem necessary for successful markets. 1 Yet attaining these preconditions also appears to depend on the level of economic wealth.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 218
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Modernization theory holds that “growth → good governance.” The argument goes that as countries grow rich, a burgeoning middle class will demand greater accountability and protection of individual rights, leading eventually to capitalist democracies. 2
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 229
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A second widely embraced theory forcefully advances a reverse causal claim: “good governance → growth.” International agencies like the World Bank and IMF, joined by many Western policy makers and academics, maintain that it is necessary to “get governance right” before markets can grow.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 239
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If achieving good governance were a mere technicality of copying best practices from the developed West, then late developers would have accomplished it long ago.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 243
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Going further, a third school points to history as the underlying cause of good governance or state capacity. This approach may be abbreviated as “history → good governance → growth.” Following a path-dependent logic, several scholars posit colonialization as the root of present-day national inequalities.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 251
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    the authors of Why Nations Fail conclude that “different patterns of institutions today are deeply rooted in the past because once society gets organized in a particular way, this tends to persist.” And they add, “This persistence and the forces that create it also explain why it is so difficult to remove world inequality and to make poor countries prosperous.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 264
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    My answer begins with a simple observation: development
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 265
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    is a coevolutionary process. States and markets interact and adapt to each other, changing mutually over time. Neither economic growth nor good governance comes first in development.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 273
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    My answers to how China—and poor and weak societies in general—escaped the poverty trap are twofold. The first: build markets with weak institutions.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 276
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    I show that the practices and features that defy norms of good governance—normally viewed as “weak” institutions—are paradoxically the raw materials for building markets when none exist. By contrast,
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 277
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    the “good” or “strong” institutions found in wealthy economies are institutions that preserve existing markets.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 286
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The second answer: create the right conditions for adaptation. History is not destiny.

    Geography?

<div class="noteText">
    China ranks among the world’s most decentralized administrations. Local governments embrace capitalism, advance policy innovations, and compete to produce economic results.

<div class="noteText">
    Their reply is that “a critical juncture,” namely Mao’s death, followed by Deng’s efforts to build a reform coalition, turned China around. Furthermore, they claim, growth under extractive institutions was possible because an extremely poor country like China had plenty of “catching up” to do. Finally, they sum up: “Some luck is key, because history always unfolds in a contingent way.” 37

<div class="noteText">
    For a start, some credit China’s boom to loosened restrictions on capitalism in an economy that possesses basic growth factors, for example, abundant cheap labor and coastal cities poised to export.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 355
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Shifting from economic to political factors, another set of explanations cites changes in bureaucratic incentives as the key to China’s growth spurt.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 361

<div class="noteText">
    These geographically limited theories not only mask wide variation in local outcomes within China, but more significantly, they underplay the role of regional inequalities in China’s national reform success.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 364

    In short, existing accounts each highlight a different piece of the grand puzzle: basic growth factors, bureaucratic incentives, incremental reforms, historical legacies, and more.

    Cast more precisely in game theoretic terms, development is a problem of making the transition from one self-reinforcing equilibrium (poverty traps) to another equilibrium (rich and modern), a process that may be termed the Great Leap.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 441
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To study complicated worlds, we can parse out the different parts into separate categories of cause and effect and then try to pin down the linear effects of a hypothesized independent variable on a dependent variable. Much of our analyses have proceeded as if social worlds are complicated.

    Poor and weak countries can escape the poverty trap by first building markets with weak institutions and, more fundamentally, by crafting environments that facilitate improvisation among the relevant players.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Particular solutions work only when they fit the needs and resources of particular contexts and the success criteria of the players involved. Instead of aspiring to copy the exact actions taken by others, what is fundamentally needed for development are conditions that spur a productive and sustained search for solutions that fit different and evolving environments.

    On the state cluster, I prioritize the bureaucracy. More specifically, I will focus on the emergence of professional bureaucracies organized along Weberian precepts or popularly regarded as “good” bureaucracies. Then, with respect to the economy, I will focus on the industrial sector, setting aside other higher-order spheres such as financial markets and corporate governance.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 738

<div class="noteText">
    Weber identifies, two stand out. 8 First, professional bureaucracies perform specialized functions through technically qualified personnel.

    Through my fieldwork, I uncovered the fact that local investment bureaus in China do not (or did not, depending on location) actually bear sole responsibility for investment work. Instead, all party and state offices, regardless of nominally assigned functions, are required and rewarded for participating in courting investors.

    The basic bureaucratic structure of local governments is nearly identical throughout China. Ministries at the central level are replicated at each administrative level and across all locales. The party and the state form two parallel hierarchies. In terms of formally assigned functions, party organs are generally responsible for political affairs (e.g., cadre appointments and propaganda), whereas state organs are in charge of regulation, economic management, and delivery of public services. In contrast to the formal separation of political party and state administration in democracies like the United States, party and state are deliberately fused in China’s political system.

Dominant theories in political economy are theories about good or strong institutions (such as professional bureaucracies, rule of law, private property rights protection) that are necessary to preserve markets that have already been built. But where markets barely exist, which is the situation facing most low-income, preindustrialized, and premodernized societies, building markets from the ground up demands drastically different institutions and strategies. Why is that? My answer is that the goals, constraints, and resources for development vary at low and middle levels of income; therefore, the selections that fit these different contexts must also be different.

    Unlike my theory, however, he interprets the differences in early and advanced development to be “additive” in nature, that is, the latter entails “more difficult problems,” which in turn “requires greater degrees of institutional capacity.” 122 In his view, early development needs only good-enough institutions, while institutions at later stages become better.

    According to Greif, these merchants were able to overcome transaction problems through an institutional innovation known as the community responsibility system (CRS). In this system, each merchant belonged to a self-governed commune, a social unit that “fell into a grey area between states and communities.”

    By the end of the thirteenth century, signs of disintegration appeared in the CRS. For example, in England, more and more merchants opted to register their personal debt in the Close Rolls, under the common law.

    Instead of raising taxes, state governments issued charters to private companies in exchange for ownership interest. Charters were essentially monopoly or exclusive rights to run certain businesses, among which banking was especially profitable.

    Within ten years from 1842, eleven states changed their constitutions, enshrining in law a body of rules that are today hailed as quintessential market-supporting institutions. These included a general incorporation law that allowed free entry to all lines of businesses, restrictions on the amount and procedures of public borrowing, and uniform property tax codes.

    The early 1990s was a time when markets in Asia were actively replacing VCDs and VHSs with new technological devices. These obsolete products were cheaply exported and sold to Nigerian traders, one of whom was named Kenneth Nnubue.

<div class="noteText">
    what is needed for reforms in poor and weak societies is not replacement of the standard good-governance package with something “easier,” 55 but rather with a different package tailored to the tasks and constraints of market building. The latter would likely involve improvising strategies that defy orthodox prescriptions.

    3. In the beginning, define success narrowly

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 4877

<div class="noteText">
    The post-Mao leadership launched market reforms by initially defining bureaucratic success narrowly as economic success, deliberately de-emphasizing other goals; achieving rapid economic results, however, required reforms across a broad range of issues. It should be noted that narrow definitions of success may come at a political price when applied to the public sector.

    We miss the obvious because standard binary labels of “weak/ strong” and “good/ bad” blinds us to the potential of nonmodern, nonformal, non-rule-of-law, and nondemocratic institutions. Our conventional and strongly rooted bias that the norms of the developed West are universally best leads us to regard any deviation from these norms only as weaknesses. 59 Consequently, institutions in developing societies are routinely identified by what they are not rather than by what they are.

    Aid professionals are long accustomed to prescribing best practices based on a universalistic assumption of good governance. They hail from similar backgrounds in finance and economics, trained at a small number of elite programs. 64 Their careers do not rest on evaluations by local aid recipients. And even if sympathetic to local voices, technocrats are constrained by organizational deliverables, where large projects with visible and scalable results are preferred over localized initiatives with uncertain payoffs. 65 All these conditions impede the adoption of adaptive approaches within aid agencies.

    The 1993 decision comprehensively tackled various distortions stemming from partial market reforms during the pre-1993 period. By now, new pressures have mounted to a near tipping point. Such problems include severe vertical fiscal imbalance, hidden debts incurred by local governments, overly rapid state-led urbanization, environmental degradation, a brewing real estate bubble, and, as I write this conclusion, an ongoing stock market meltdown that has wiped out stock values about ten times the size of Greece’s economy.

    Zhao Shukai, a researcher at the State Council, provides an insightful assessment. In the example of petitioning, he observes that higher-level governments hold subordinates firmly accountable to complaints and petitions lodged by citizens. Officials at the grassroots are subject to hard targets that assess their performance by the number of petitions lodged in their jurisdiction. 71 But the higher levels pay little regard to “whether the grassroots governments have the responsibility or due power to deal with petitioning.” The result, Zhao concludes, is that “the assessment system for maintaining social stability not only damages grassroots governments’ trust for their superiors,” but also incites opportunistic citizens to “take advantage of this unreasonable assessment system.” 72 In other words, if this trend continues, local authorities would become neither formally accountable to society nor free to act single-mindedly toward narrow goals. This political mutation combines the worst of authoritarianism and populism. 73

    Instead of relying on the bureaucracy as an agent of change, as it has done in the past, the CCP must release and channel the immense creative potential of Chinese society. It is simplistic to assume that such a change has to involve formal democratization.

    If China fails to adapt to the twenty-first century, economic stagnation could stir domestic political instability that may in turn threaten international peace and order. The United States is unlikely to benefit from unrest in China given the inextricable ties between the two economies. If China succeeds, it will be a turning point in human history. For the first time in more than three hundred years, a non-Western nation may surpass the economic and political might of the West, and the balance of global power would be radically altered.
