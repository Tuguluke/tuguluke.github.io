    A particular peril of this sort of work is that it can leave the impression that China’s economic development has been the working out of a master plan designed in advance and supervised at every point by wise officials with exact knowledge of the consequences of all their actions. This is of course absurd: China’s economic story was created by fierce battles between rival groups, decisions taken under emergency conditions with imperfect information, the belated and partial rectification of past errors, and the constant swirl of a billion people seeking personal advantage.

<div class="noteText">
    Since 1979, China’s GDP per person has grown at an average rate of about 8.5 percent a year. At that rate, income doubles every 9 years. The income of the average Chinese person is thus more than 30 times higher today than it was in 1979.

    In 1962, development economist Alexander Gerschenkron introduced the concept of “the advantage of backwardness.” 3 His idea was that a poor country could grow very fast for a long time simply by marrying the technology already developed in rich countries with its low-cost labor force. This kind of growth—which does not require much innovation—is called “catch-up” growth.

    Simply by gradually letting go of these state controls, China enjoyed a productivity boom as economic decision making shifted from crusty state bureaucrats to private and public actors who, driven by increasing market forces, tried to squeeze more productivity and profit out of the assets they controlled.

    Second, China chose to open up just at the moment when logistics technologies such as containerized shipping made it cost-effective for companies to split up production chains so that high-cost components produced in one country could be shipped to a second (low labor-cost) country for final assembly and then shipped to consumers in a third and often very distant country.

    Countries that produced a lot of commodities (many of them in the developing world) benefited from the higher prices China was willing to pay for their output.

    A second implication of China’s size is that it had much more latitude to conduct large-scale trials of policies before rolling them out nationwide. The country has thirty-one province-level jurisdictions, 1 of which the smallest (Tibet) has a population of 3 million and the largest (Guangdong) 104 million—about the same as Mexico. The average province has a population of around 45 million, roughly that of Spain. In many respects, it is thus appropriate to think of China as a continent-sized assemblage of countries.

    Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) fell for four main reasons: The economy did not grow fast enough, leading to frustration and resentment, and this failure resulted from insufficient use of market mechanisms. The CPSU’s propaganda and information systems were too closed and ideologically rigid, preventing officials from getting accurate and timely knowledge about conditions both inside and outside the Soviet Union. Decision making was far too centralized and hence far too slow. Once reforms started under Gorbachev, they undermined the core principle of the party’s absolute monopoly on political power. 15

The plan identifies ten high-tech priority sectors, ranging from semiconductors to robotics to new energy technologies and declares that China should assume a global leadership position in most of these industries within one or two decades.

    The typical structure of a Chinese SOE business group is as follows: Top layer: unlisted parent group entity, controlled by the government via SASAC. Second layer: corporate subsidiaries wholly or majority-owned by the group entity. These may include subsidiaries listed on Chinese or overseas stock markets. In most cases, one of these controlled subsidiaries is a finance company. Third layer: minority-controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures, which usually enable the group to take an interest in peripheral activities. For instance, CNPC, one of whose core interests is the wholesale distribution of natural gas via pipelines, also has stakes in various city gas companies that deliver gas to households.

More than half of government revenues come from VAT (which is mainly paid by companies) and the corporate income tax (Figure 8.4). The personal income tax accounts for just 8 percent of revenues, and while this share has been creeping up in recent years, it is still far below international norms.

    Debt can rise for many reasons, not just profligacy and inefficiency. The steady rise in debt in most rich countries since the 1950s is largely attributable to innovations in corporate finance (bonds and commercial paper) and consumer credit (flexible mortgages, home equity lines, credit cards) that enabled both companies and households to sustainably finance more of their assets with debt rather than with equity. (This process is called “financial deepening.”)

    Inability to pay foreign debt is not a problem because foreign debts are small—about 10 percent of GDP—and foreign reserves of about $ 3 trillion give the central bank plenty of ammunition to ward off a speculative attack on the currency. A domestic liquidity squeeze is also unlikely because the domestic savings rate is very high (about 40 percent of GDP) and much of that saving is still funneled into bank deposits, the safest form of funding for a financial system.

    First, the Chinese middle class is neither the middle nor the majority of society. In this chapter, we will offer a generous estimate that the middle class comprises a bit less than 40 percent of the national population, enjoying incomes in the upper third of China’s income distribution. In other words, the people with a middle-class lifestyle in China constitute an elite, rather than a majority “middle class” in the American or European sense. This has an important political implication: the Chinese middle class is unlikely to become an advocate for political change anytime soon, since it is a privileged minority that benefits disproportionately from
