<div class="noteText">
    Appreciation is fundamentally about relationship and human connection. At a literal level it says, “thanks.” But appreciation also conveys, “I see you,” “I know how hard you’ve been working,” and “You matter to me.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - APPRECIATION > Page 32 · Location 520
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    When people complain that they don’t get enough feedback at work, they often mean that they wonder whether anyone notices or cares how hard they’re working. They don’t want advice. They want appreciation.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - COACHING > Page 32 · Location 530
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Coaching can be sparked by two different kinds of needs. One is the need to improve your knowledge or skills in order to build capability and meet novel challenges.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - COACHING > Page 32 · Location 532
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In the second kind of coaching feedback, the feedback giver is not responding to your need to develop certain skills. Instead, they are identifying a problem in your relationship: Something is missing, something is wrong. This type of coaching is often prompted by emotion: hurt, fear, anxiety, confusion, loneliness, betrayal, or anger.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - EVALUATION > Page 33 · Location 539
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Evaluation tells you where you stand. It’s an assessment, ranking, or rating.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - EVALUATION > Page 33 · Location 542
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Evaluations are always in some respect comparisons, implicitly or explicitly, against others or against a particular set of standards. “You are not a good husband” is shorthand for “You are not a good husband compared with what I hoped for in a husband” or “compared with my saintly father” or “compared with my last three husbands.” Evaluations align expectations, clarify consequences, and inform decision making.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Three qualities are required for appreciation to count. First, it has to be specific. This is tricky; most of us offer both appreciation and positive evaluation in grand strokes like “Good work!” or “You were fabulous!” or “Thanks for everything!”

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - WHAT HELPS? > Page 42 · Location 690
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Two things keep us on track: getting our purposes aligned, and separating (as much as possible) evaluation from coaching and appreciation. GET ALIGNED: KNOW THE PURPOSE AND DISCUSS IT Cross-transactions happen when the giver and receiver are misaligned. The fix? Discuss the purpose of the feedback explicitly. It seems obvious, but even competent, well-meaning people can go their whole lives without ever having this part of the conversation.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    (1) What’s my purpose in giving/ receiving this feedback? (2) Is it the right purpose from my point of view? (3) Is it the right purpose from the other person’s point of view? Is your primary goal coaching, evaluation, or appreciation? Are you trying to improve, to assess, or to say thanks and be supportive?

<div class="noteText">
    “Feedback” is really three different things, with different purposes: Appreciation —motivates and encourages. Coaching —helps increase knowledge, skill, capability, growth, or raises feelings in the relationship. Evaluation —tells you where you stand, aligns expectations, and informs decision making. We need all three, but often talk at cross-purposes. Evaluation is the loudest and can drown out the other two. (And all coaching includes a bit of evaluation.) Be thoughtful about what you need and what you’re being offered, and get aligned.

<div class="noteText">
    We listen to the feedback with this question in mind: “What’s wrong with this feedback?” And as it turns out, we can almost always find something. WE’RE GOOD AT WRONG SPOTTING
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - WE’RE GOOD AT WRONG SPOTTING > Page 47 · Location 758
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Why is wrong spotting so easy? Because there’s almost always something wrong—something the feedback giver is overlooking, shortchanging, or misunderstanding. About you, about the situation, about the constraints you’re under. And givers compound the problem by delivering feedback that is vague, making it easy for us to overlook, shortchange, and misunderstand what they are saying. But in the end, wrong spotting not only defeats wrong feedback, it defeats learning.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - UNDERSTANDING IS JOB ONE > Page 47 · Location 762

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - GIVER AND RECEIVER INTERPRET THE LABEL DIFFERENTLY > Page 50 · Location 787
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In our minds, we have a high-definition movie that captures all that we mean by those labels—the bad behavior, the angry tone, the irritating habits that we endure.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - WHAT’S UNDER THE LABEL? > Page 53 · Location 818
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    So to clarify the feedback under the label we need to “be specific” about two things: (1) where the feedback is coming from, and (2) where the feedback is going.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - They Confuse Data and Interpretation (We All Do) > Page 55 · Location 861
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Artificial intelligence expert Roger Schank has an observation about this: He notes that while computers are organized around managing and accessing data, human intelligence is organized around stories. 2 We take in selective data and make immediate interpretations, resulting in instant judgment-laced labels: That meeting was a waste of time. Your skirt’s too short. Those people at the next table can’t parent properly. If we were asked what we had witnessed, we’d say: “I saw people parenting badly.” We think that’s the actual data because that’s how we’ve stored it in memory. But the actual data was the particular way the woman looked at the baby or the way the man did (or didn’t) respond when the baby wailed. Bad parenting is not the data; it’s our auto-story about the encounter.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - When Receiving Evaluation: Clarify Consequences and Expectations > Page 59 · Location 907
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    It’s not easy to clarify advice, and it can be even tougher to clarify the consequences and expectations that follow from an evaluation. Why? Because we’re still vibrating from the impact of the evaluation itself. Whether we are delighted or devastated, we’re not in a curious state of mind. Yet it’s particularly important to understand the forward-looking part of feedback when it’s evaluation. What does this mean for me? What will happen next, what is expected of me? Given where I stand, what should I do now?
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - SHIFT FROM WRONG SPOTTING TO DIFFERENCE SPOTTING > Page 61 · Location 934
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    But we’ve been leaving something out. You aren’t trying to get the giver’s ideas into your empty head, you’re trying to get the giver’s ideas into your full head. You have your own views and opinions regarding this feedback, your own data and interpretations, your own life experiences, assumptions, and values. All the sorts of things that form the giver’s feedback in the first place are also going on in your head.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - SHIFT FROM WRONG SPOTTING TO DIFFERENCE SPOTTING > Page 61 · Location 939
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    There’s another way to think about it. As receivers, we shouldn’t use our views to dismiss the giver’s views, but neither should we discard our own. Working to first understand their views doesn’t mean we pretend we don’t have life experiences or opinions. Instead, we need to understand their views even as we’re aware of our own. And that’s almost impossible to do unless we make a key shift—away from that’s wrong and toward tell me more: Let’s figure out why we see this differently.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Implicit Rules > Page 65 · Location 1006
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    One of the primary reasons we interpret data differently is that we have different rules in our heads about how things should be. But we don’t think of them as our rules. We think of them as the rules.

    Feedback is delivered in vague labels, and we are prone to wrong spotting. To understand your feedback, discuss where it is: Coming from: their data and interpretations Going to: advice, consequences, expectations Ask: What’s different about The data we are looking at Our interpretations and implicit rules Ask: What’s right about the feedback to seek out what’s legit and what concerns you have in common. Working together to get a more complete picture maximizes the chances you will (both) learn something.

<div class="noteText">
    Let’s start on the far left with our own thoughts and feelings. From these, we formulate intentions—what we’re trying to do, what we want to have happen. To achieve our intentions, we do and say things, we put behavior out into the world. These behaviors have an impact on others, and based on this impact, others develop a story about our intentions and character. They then offer some version of these perceptions to us as feedback. By the time others are describing you—to you—the figure they’re describing may bear only vague resemblance to the “you” you know. We flinch, we squint, we shake our heads. We don’t recognize ourselves.

    Thus we arrive at the cross-currents swirling around her situation: Annabelle is often dismayed when team members come to her with the kinds of questions that she would have felt eager to figure out on her own. She believes they aren’t trying or don’t care enough. As a result she often feels impatient, annoyed, and disappointed in her team. This creates a misalignment between her internal thoughts and feelings on the one hand (arrow 1), and her intentions (arrow 2) on the other.

Third, we need to help givers be clearer about their original feedback, especially when the feedback itself relates to the relationship.

Relationship triggers create switchtrack conversations, where we have two topics on the table and talk past each other. Spot the two topics and give each its own track.

If they need examples of what you’re talking about, describe them as you recall them, along with their effect on you. The Time Frame. How long is the boundary likely to be in place? Do you need time to sort things out for yourself, to adjust your self-image, to take care of other priorities first, to find your feet as a new stepparent or new leader? Let them know if the boundary is time limited, and if not, how they might check in with you about it without violating the boundary. (“ Can I ask how things are going with that thing I’m not supposed to mention?”) Their Assent. Don’t assume that they understand you or agree. Instead, ask. When they say, “Yes, I will honor your request,” it’s not just about you anymore. They’re making a commitment, and that enlists their identity and reputation in living up to their promise.

Do you have more?”), as are questions that cross-examine (“ But isn’t it true that . . . ?” “If so, how do you explain . . . ?”). These are external signs of the wrestling match going on between you and your internal voice. Your internal voice is saying, “Can you believe this guy? Let me at ’em!” and you are replying, “Hold up! We’re supposed to be asking questions!” The result is “inquiry” that’s loaded with frustration and assertion. What to do, then, when you are experiencing strong feelings? If you’re overwhelmed, don’t try to fight through it and inquire. Instead, assert. Replace hot inquiry like this: “Do you actually think that what you’re saying is consistent or fair?” with a thoughtful assertion like this: “What you’re suggesting seems inconsistent with the criteria you’ve used for others in my position. That doesn’t seem fair to me.” You can then circle back to listening: “Are there aspects of this that I’m missing?”

    Finally, as we’ve said, too many workplaces suffer from mutual appreciation deficit disorder. Even the most satisfied among us can sometimes feel underappreciated for how much we put into our jobs and for how much crap we put up with along the way. Formal recognition programs are helpful, but we care more about appreciation from our immediate coworkers and supervisors than we do about ceremonial recognition from seven levels above. Rote thank-yous lose currency fast, but an authentic “Hey, watching you handle that complicated task so well is making me rethink my approach to those problems” can mean more than any plaque or gift certificate.

    If you want to nudge people out of a fixed identity and into a growth identity, two things help. First, teach them about it. A “growth identity” is not a concept most people are aware of until they hear about it. Hold a session on the difference between fixed and growth identities; let people discuss the topic, ask questions, express doubt. Talk about the differences in how people metabolize positive and negative feedback, and the implications for how to coach one another on teams. Float the concept of honest and supportive mirrors, and get the grapevine to actually grow something beyond rumors—peers helping one another to see their blind spots and process feedback for what’s right, not just venting about what’s wrong. Get the ideas into the air and onto people’s radar.

    In foreign affairs the concept of multitrack diplomacy describes the range of players who are involved in creating systemic change and building peace. Track 1 is the official government track—involved in negotiations, summits, sanctions, and treaties. Track 2 is the unofficial but often significant work done by others—community members and grassroots organizations, et cetera. 9 We’ve borrowed this concept to describe the two tracks that organizations can put in place to support individual learning. They need to have Track 1 structures that support evaluation and mentoring. Those include performance management systems, mentoring programs, trainings, and the like. But in many ways Track 2 activities are even more crucial to learning. These include the informal coaching conversations among friends, peers, and mentors; the stories of success and failure; discussions of best practices and skills that did or didn’t help; and even an exchange of favorite books. You might have honest mirror and supportive mirror lunches with friends, combining social time with helping each other to learn. Track 2 gives a formal name to these important informal interactions, and that helps you talk about it and bring it more consciously into the culture of the organization.

    Our advice is to notice that what might hurt someone in the short term might help them in the longer term, and indeed, withholding important coaching because it might be painful—to them and to us—can do them real damage over time.

    Regardless of context or the company you keep, you are the most important person in your own learning. Your organization or team or boss might support or stifle feedback. Either way, they can’t stop you from learning. You don’t have to depend on your annual review or your boss’s willingness to mentor. You can watch, ask questions, and solicit suggestions from coworkers, customers, partners, and friends. You don’t have to wait around for someone to train you to sell more shoes. Observe whoever sells the most and try to figure out what they’re doing differently. And ask them to watch you. Whatever they suggest, try it on. Experiment with the advice, and if the shoe fits, wear it.
