    My study of economics had taught me that the ideology of many conservatives was wrong; their almost religious belief in the power of markets—so great that we could largely simply rely on unfettered markets for running the economy—had no basis in theory or evidence.

    How did we get here, where are we going, and what can we do to change course? I approach these questions as an economist, and not surprisingly, I see at least part of the answer lying in our economic failures—the failure to handle well the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service-sector economy, to tame the financial sector, to properly manage globalization and its consequences, and most importantly, to respond to the growing inequality, as we seemed to be evolving into an economy and democracy of the 1 percent, for the 1 percent and by the 1 percent.

    The party strategy seemed predicated on two hypotheses, which, if true, bode poorly for the country: that ordinary citizens are so shortsighted that they will focus on the small reductions in their taxes now, ignoring their temporary nature, and the fact that for a majority in the middle taxes would increase; and that what really matters in American democracy is money. Keep the rich happy and they will shower the Republican Party with contributions, and the contributions will buy the votes necessary to sustain the policies.

    It pretended to be based on advances in our understanding of markets, but the truth was just the opposite: advances in economics over the past seventy years had identified the limits of free markets. Of course, anyone with open eyes could have seen this for themselves: episodic unemployment, sometimes massive, as in the Great Depression and pollution so bad in some places that air was unbreathable were just the two most obvious “proofs” that markets on their own don’t necessarily work well.

    Secondly, we need to recognize that the wealth of a nation rests on two pillars. Nations grow wealthier—achieving higher standards of living—by becoming more productive, and the most important source of increases in productivity is the result of increases in knowledge.

    Sixth, because the rules of the game and so many other aspects of our economy and society depend on the government, what the government does is vital; politics and economics cannot be separated.

Focus on the competition that always remains within a market, rather than the power that each of the few dominant firms in the market has. Look at a standard college economics textbook.

    Moreover, advocates of globalization emphasize how exports create jobs, but they fail to mention the number of jobs destroyed by imports. If trade is roughly balanced, and if imports are more labor-intensive than exports, then overall, trade destroys jobs. If monetary policy responds by lowering interest rates, and the lower interest rates increase investment or consumption, full employment might be restored. But sometimes monetary policy doesn’t work, or at least work well enough to achieve full employment.

    Renegotiating trade agreements will neither reduce the trade deficit nor lead to a return of manufacturing jobs. This is because the trade deficit is determined largely by macroeconomic factors, not by trade agreements. Macroeconomic factors determine the exchange rate—which is simply the value of one currency in terms of another—and the exchange rate is critical in determining exports and imports. When the value of the dollar is high, we export less and import more.

    Economic growth depends on two factors: growth in the size of the labor force, and increases in productivity, output per hour. When either one goes up, so does the output of the economy. Of course, what matters is not just growth in national output, but in living standards of ordinary Americans, 2 and that requires not just increases in productivity, but that ordinary citizens get a fair share of that increase.

    When workers are taxed, they might not work as hard; when capital is taxed, it might go elsewhere or people might not save as much. 53 Not so for land. It’s there, whether taxed or not. Indeed, the great nineteenth-century economist Henry George argued that returns to land—rents—should be taxed at 100 percent. 54 Taxing rents can lead to a more productive economy. Now, a large fraction of savings goes into land rather than into productive assets (investments in research, plants, and equipment). Taxing the capital gains on land and rents would encourage more savings to be directed toward productive capital.

    Obama and the Democrats worked hard to create a system in which all individuals who were already covered could keep their insurance, but that also ensured that everyone else would be covered. It was an imperfect system, but it was a framework which could be improved over time. A critical missing part couldn’t get through Congress—the public option. This option would have made Medicare available to all who wanted it, for a price. This would have meant that no one would be left without insurance, should all the private insurance companies decide not to provide it in some locale, and would have simultaneously provided competition, restraining the abuse of market power in a sector in which the limited number of firms in most geographic regions makes that likely. Trump and the Republicans, by removing the individual mandate, may well have succeeded in breaking Obamacare, a program which has turned out to be enormously popular.

    Part of the revitalization of Social Security would involve expanding the instruments in which it can invest, away from low-yielding US government bonds.

The returns to our economy from such infrastructure investments are large. And providing a modest fraction of those returns to bondholders—at, say, 5 percent—would simultaneously put the Social Security Trust Fund on a sounder footing.

    There is a simple answer, recognizing that changes in modern technology and information systems enable the creation of a twenty-first-century mortgage system. Among the central problems of any mortgage finance system are screening (ascertaining whether a particular home is appropriate for a particular family, and that there is adequate equity in the home) and the enforcement of the terms of the mortgage, in particular the collection of payments. For the former, the critical database is the history of family income—and that database already comprehensively resides in the public sector, at the Social Security Administration and in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

    And while in the run up to the 2008 crisis there was massive fraud (lying) in the process of securitization (where mortgages are pooled together into “securities,” which in turn were sold on to investors), 14 there is likely to be much less of this when such information is reported to the IRS, partly because the consequences can be more severe.

    The myth, though, shapes news coverage: when our media discovers someone who has made it from the bottom to the top, they give the story airtime and ink, and this in turn reinforces our preconception of ourselves. Psychologists call this confirmatory bias: we give weight to the evidence that is consistent with our prior beliefs—our sustaining myths.

    This is just one of the many ways in which standard economics has wrongly modeled behavior and human nature, but, in doing so, it has led to an economy that has actually been shaping Americans and their behavior in ways that are often inconsistent with higher values.

    When the Constitution was written we were an agrarian society, with more than 70 percent of the population directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. By the 1950s, we were a manufacturing/ industrial society. Today, we are a postindustrial society, with manufacturing comprising less than 10 percent of our labor force. These changing economic circumstances necessitate a changing role for government.

    These battles for racial justice had their counterpoint in the fight for economic justice. Inequality and the agglomeration of market and political power reached new heights in the Gilded Age at the end of the nineteenth century. Then progressive legislation, including laws intended to ensure competition, brought us back from the precipice. After economic inequalities again reached new heights in the 1920s, the social and economic legislation of the New Deal opened up a new era in which Americans benefited from the economic security provided by Social Security and unemployment insurance, and economic powers were rebalanced through legislation curbing the financial sector and giving new life to the labor movement.

    Libertarians on the Right see government as interfering with their freedom. Corporations on the Right see government as imposing regulations and taxes that decrease their profits. The 1 percent worry about the potential of a strong government using its powers to take money away from them and redistribute it to the needy. All of these actors have an incentive to portray government as inefficient and contributing to the country’s ills.

    These include young people who have not yet lost their idealism, those in older generations who still cling to ideals of equality of opportunity and shared prosperity, and those who recall the struggle for civil rights in which so many joined with their hearts and souls—and for a moment glimpsed some progress, only to see this darker cloud come over the country. This alternative world is not based on reconstructing an imagined past but constructing a realistic future, using our knowledge of economics and politics, including what we have learned from these failures of recent decades. Properly designed, well-regulated markets, working together with governments and a broad array of civil society institutions, are the only way forward.
