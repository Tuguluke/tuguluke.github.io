    Introduction
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 6 · Location 39
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The phrase “everyone is gone” or “disappeared” (Uy.: adem yoq) is something that I heard Uyghurs repeat on a regular basis during my last research trip to Xinjiang in 2018.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 7 · Location 46
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Over the next three decades, the settler populations took over local institutions—the banks, the schools, civil administration—and Uyghurs were pushed out of more autonomous livelihoods into the cities in search of work. What they found in the cities, though, was widespread discrimination.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 7 · Location 50
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Rental and house-ownership regulations often prevented Uyghurs from becoming permanent residents in the city, while Han migrant resettlement in Xinjiang cities was encouraged and subsidized by the government. Evictions, land seizures, police brutality, and religious oppression all played a role in an increase in the frequency of Uyghur protests, some of which were violent, and which in some limited cases met international definitions of terrorism. As the Chinese state took up the rhetoric of the global War on Terror emanating from North America and Europe, nearly all forms of Uyghur protest were labeled terrorism, and Uyghurs who defended their Islamic and ethnic traditions were described as extremists.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 8 · Location 66

<div class="noteText">
    What is clear is that the “reeducation camp” campaign explicitly targeted Uyghurs in positions of social and cultural influence. And Perhat Tursun was certainly one of those people.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    By shifting the frame of the narrative of colonial violence away from the authority of the state toward the work it takes for the colonized to live, The Backstreets gave A. A. a new way of speaking and being heard.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 10 · Location 89
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Nearly all Uyghur migrants I interviewed said that the experiences of alienation and rejection that I described from the novel resonated with aspects of their own lives: the cruel smiles, the open hostility, the bureaucratic indifference. Reading The Backstreets became a method of helping young men to tell their own stories and explore their own life paths.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 10 · Location 98
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    How, in the novel, dehumanization—a process that comes from the way Han Chinese people, the majority group in China, see the Turkic Muslim protagonist as valueless because of his appearance and the language he speaks—was folded into this cold sensation.

    He seemed very honest, with everything appearing on the surface. He listened intently when I spoke, a blank stare mixed with a burning alertness. He seemed like a man starving for life.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    What I am trying to write about is human experience. I am interested in every form of human thought. I read the scriptures of every faith. I think religion is beautiful. It’s like poetry. I believe there is no final truth. And I believe that mental illness has always existed. Mostly it exists in forms of normality.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 14 · Location 153
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    “Milan Kundera, the Czech writer, is also writing about human experience, but because of his circumstances, his fiction gets read as somehow political. Actually, it doesn’t start with politics, it just gets pulled into it. Human relationships are the center; they just get blocked by politics. The same is true for most writers if they’re really honest.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 14 · Location 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    nearly all Uyghur cultural production is viewed as “sensitive.” Unlike novels written by Han authors such as Xu Zecheng, who depicts Han migrant life in Running Through Beijing, any depiction of Uyghur interactions with Han society must account for the way poverty and ethno-racialization produce a cascading effect of alienation. For Uyghur contemporary authors, urban life is not simply a question of rural-origin class difference, it is a question of epistemic difference and the way their bodies themselves are read. Because Uyghurs speak a different language, cannot pass as Han, and claim a nativeness (Uy: yerlik) to their ancestral lands in southern Xinjiang, their encounter with urban Han people is more than simply one of class difference. It is a question of colonial possession and domination, and the way discourse—the permitted speech that shapes social norms—has the power to produce a banal normalization of othering. In this context “Uyghur terrorist” or “extremist” replace older words such as “savage” or “barbarian.”

    To Tursun’s thinking this precipitated a profound lack of curiosity regarding Uyghur knowledge. In fact, the existence of Uyghur thought and life itself began to be perceived as a threat.

<div class="noteText">
    On January 30, 2018, I received confirmation that Tursun had been disappeared. In early 2020, the news filtered out that he was reportedly given a sixteen-year prison sentence. Tursun will be sixty-seven years old when he is released. The world may never see the five unfinished novels he was working on. He was disappeared at the height of his powers. What remains for now are snatches of his work, most of it yet to be published, and scenes from the world he created.

<div class="noteText">
    People like Perhat miss the 1980s, when no one was willing to listen to someone else’s truth. Everyone seemed to think for themselves back then, and no one seemed to be bothered by difference. Now difference is seen as a weakness.

    People don’t recognize how bleak the situation is here now, because we don’t have dramatic statistics of how many people have died or disappeared. The situation is more complex than this. The way it works is by breaking people’s spirit and weakening their sense of self.

    One time, my friends in prison asked if they could watch Uyghur song and dance videos and the guard said yes. So thirty or so prisoners gathered in one cell and watched the videos. After a few hours, they were happy and were ready to return to their cells, but then the warden said, “No, you asked to watch films, so please keep watching.” So they watched the videos for twenty-four hours. Then they asked again if they could leave, because now they were becoming very uncomfortable, but the warden said, “No, you asked for this, please keep watching.” In the end, they watched the videos for seventy-two hours. The room was full of shit and piss and thirty men; finally, they said they would never ask to watch films again, and he let them go back to their cells.

    Tursun is suspicious of ideology that masquerades as truth, suspicious of violent resistance, of false altruism, of easy solutions. He is conscious of who is authorized to speak and for whom. Underneath all of this is a Uyghur lifeworld demanding to be recognized as inextinguishable. Like Coetzee, Tursun uses silence to evoke, but not ventriloquize, those who gaze at the life of the outsider. These silences, too, are full of meaning. The blankness of the gazes that confront the protagonist allude to something deeper, more fundamental to the way Uyghurs experienced the Chinese city.

    At its heart, then, the novel appears to be about those creatures whose existence is always outside, unwanted. It is about the conditions in which racialized ethnic others always-already know their place in the world. This is shown to them through their social encounters and the structures of power that prevent them from succeeding.

    The narrative centers on his endless struggle against the pull of social death. His primary strategy is to retreat into his mind, seeking what Søren Kierkegaard, one of Tursun’s influences, might refer to as a “negative liberation.” But this liberation is always incomplete, always partial; a delay tactic and form of palliative protection.

    The cities he was talking about had a population of at least four and a half million Uyghurs. Even his grandson’s life span would not give him enough time to sort each of these four and a half million persons into friend and enemy categories. So it seemed that rather than wasting his time with that, he had made peace with being the enemy of the whole population of the Six Cities. Still, it would only be possible to erase all of the people from the Six Cities if they would come to him, line up, and wait for his great cleavers to fall on their heads!

    I think the decline in the longevity of the population is due to psychological pressure. Especially the paranoid and hysterical dissatisfaction that comes from the desire to kill being suppressed by modern civilization. An animosity toward the city might also be caused by this.

    Later, I realized that the root of the fears that humans have is just this: infinity. The infinity of the sky, of time, of not knowing what comes after death, threatens humans.

    When a teacher in an empty classroom said that a change in a numerical amount would result in a change in quality, I imagined that this number might be a soul and that this quality might be a body. This description of the relationship between changing numbers and changes in quality gave me a sign of how changing the soul would affect changes in the body. The changes in the body that came from a lustful imagination were the proof of this. Following this logic, I imagined that the face of a person who was full of evil thoughts would gradually become uglier and that his legs would become twisted.

    They will spend their whole life trying to determine their position—becoming anxious and griping about its vagueness. Everyone is a wanderer in space. Even the notion of possession carried out by those who own land, palaces, and mansions is in fact just an assumption based on imitation. Some people aren’t even satisfied by owning their own lands, palaces, and mansions, but to make it their own instead want to own whole cities, countries, and the universe itself. All of this comes from a kind of worry that is based on the feeling that a person can’t determine a lasting position in the universe. The more this happens, the more a person wants to own their place in the world and deny the idea that nothing can really belong to them. Or that they themselves were born into this world for no other reason than to be a wanderer for their whole life. They want to deny all of this by madly thinking that they can own things unceasingly.

    And furthermore, that these centers do not have any spaces around them. If everything is the center, how could someone determine their position? This is a problem because they are standing in the center of the world, while at the same time others are also standing in the center of the world. Compared to this, people’s original structuring of space into districts, cities, countries, and continents is a kind of foolish game. But at the same time, as people become caught up as characters in this scenario, they nevertheless begin to think that they are actually real characters.

    The fog kept infiltrating my body and gave me a heavy, cold reverberation in my dark interior. My body was turning into mud. Water and earth were mixing together, but there was no sacred breath in me.

    That’s right, the greatest thing in the world is living. There is nothing greater than living! What outraged him the most was that I was alive. It follows, then, that my ability to live must be of great value. My very existence was his greatest source of frustration.

    In one massacre that happened sixty years ago, people were killed house by house. Sometime later there was another massacre in which people were randomly killed as targets for target practice. The number of people killed in the first massacre, where people were killed house by house, was a hundred times greater than that of people killed in the second massacre. Yet people were more outraged by the massacre in which people were killed randomly. They couldn’t accept this randomness.

    Because the massacre took place in an orderly way, it seemed like an acceptable thing to people, and they stayed silent, bowing their heads. But they couldn’t stand the random killings and rose up in the streets in revolt.

    Who had I been, what was I, and who was I going to be? Suddenly I felt that no matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to remember. Not only did I not even know who I was, but I also didn’t know what role I was playing now. My consciousness was gradually fading. I had already lost the very concept of my identity. Now I sensed that I couldn’t become anything. I felt it possible that other people wouldn’t even let me be myself. I was lost in the infinite crowds of humanity. I realized that everyone became a wanderer after they were born. After they touch the ground for the first time and utter their first cry, they have difficulty finding a proper identity for themselves. They spend their whole lives trying to determine their own identity. In the end, their identity concept is only shadows that reflected their fantasies. I realized that people felt restless due to the horrors of their nightmares. Everyone was a wanderer in the universe and that the ideas of fame, power, and respect were always just a shadow that could vanish at a moment’s notice. Others, not satisfied with their social positions or with the amount of fame and respect they had garnered, tried instead to live in a state of eternal fame. A name is given to a person by others. You get used to it when you are very young, and then begin to think that it really is your own name. In reality, it is just a bunch of meaningless phonemes. If newborn babies are named after great people from history, they never actually become those people themselves. On the contrary, their bodies will carry the names of those who lived a thousand years ago, and those names include with them the linguistic system, numerologies, and orders of those whose names they have received. As a thinker who lived several thousand years ago in India said, one body’s senses and the thoughts inside it are not enough to create a self. If it were a self, it would surely totally belong to a person. But a person cannot totally control their body or every change inside their body. If a disease suddenly appears, you don’t even know which part of your body is diseased. So how can you call yourself a self? No matter what people call me, I just accept that small number of sounds that people use to represent my identity, and I just try to know who I am based on that generally known name.

    Was there no way to escape from them other than in death?! Kneeling, crying, even dying, everything was useless under their gaze. Because a violent light emitted from those eyes covering the whole world, my tiny, completely different, lonely, skinny, miserable body couldn’t be tolerated anywhere in this wide universe. The light from those eyes could infect the trash in the gutter like a plague, making it as mean as they were. As a result, the trash would become as heavy as the whole of life and the earth itself. This tiny form of mine would welcome that trash to rush down like a flood from the mountains. It would be massive, able to destroy me immediately under its crushing weight. The mean smell from this garbage would make me forget any sort of smell that might come from a woman’s body.
