    That vast roundup was the first known instance of a computer-generated mass incarceration, and its victims were almost all Uyghurs, the Turkic Muslim population whose Central Asian homeland, Xinjiang—or as we call it, East Turkistan—was handed over to Mao Zedong by Stalin in 1949, after a very brief period of independence.

    But the real reason is this: Beijing does not consider the Uyghurs to be “Chinese” enough. The authorities perceive their centuries-old ethnonational identity, religion and cultural heritage as disloyalty to the party and a source of future political threat to the state. Uyghurs have their own language, literature and history, formed over thousands of years at the point where Buddhist, Manichaeism and Muslim identities have historically overlapped.

    China’s main interest in Xinjiang is, however, the land. Located on the fringes of Central Asia’s vast steppes, the region—the largest in China, roughly the size of Alaska—contains huge tracts of natural resources and minerals (petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, copper, lead, zinc) and long stretches of fertile agricultural land.

    For the first time since the heyday of the antebellum South, cotton slavery is once again polluting the global economy on an industrial scale. Here we are in the third decade of the twentieth century, witnessing a population’s genocide on a massive scale. The tactics used to implement this genocide are reminiscent of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution, but on digital steroids. Since Mao’s day, Beijing has updated its technique with an arsenal of the latest technology, much of it stolen from Silicon Valley and adapted to its own malignant purposes.

    They call themselves the “Becoming Family” program, and the spies live in homes to report on suspicious Muslim-related activities. Imagine if the East German Stasi were not just spying on you, but had their spies living inside your flat, pretending to be your family and using your own children to spy on you. That’s where we are in this region.

    I sit in on the most chilling video calls: desperate mothers and fathers calling home to speak to their kids, only to see a video image of their child sitting on the knee of a Chinese cop. Quite often the children, who have been brainwashed by these officers, will act coolly toward their own parents. It’s hard to describe how heartbreaking it is to see parents, afraid they may never see their kids in person again, unable to connect emotionally with their own children.

    Given the vast scale of China’s persecution, why are we not hearing more about this genocide unfolding before our very eyes? Well, for a start, the world didn’t know the full extent of the Nazi Holocaust until US and other Allied troops marched into Dachau and Bergen-Belsen in 1945. And certainly, China has banned journalists and independent observers from being allowed within miles of the camps (although it did allow Disney to shoot the movie Mulan almost within sight of a number of concentration camps).

    Beijing released the images to try to sanitize what they were doing. It publishes carefully curated pictures of the imposing buildings, of Uyghur men in blue coveralls sitting in yards behind razor wire and with armed guards behind them. Then it says to the world, “Look, these are just normal work training facilities.” It puts out pictures of little Uyghur kids, separated from their parents in special schools where they are dressed in traditional colorful Chinese robes—red and yellow, with old-fashioned hats on—something not even modern Chinese kids wear to school.

    One truly frightening aspect of countries not denouncing China’s action is this: they might actually want to copy the lessons learned there. China’s burgeoning model of capitalism without democracy will appeal to many authoritarian rulers and will come to shape the ideological struggle of the coming century.

    The reeducation camp wasn’t hidden out of sight, like Stalin’s gulags that had once sprawled just across the border in Siberia. In fact, this one was in downtown Kashgar, in an old Soviet-era government building, a brutalist slab of early-twentieth-century concrete whose windows were boarded up to prevent inmates from seeing more than thin cracks of sunlight.

    In reality, there were few places that would actually take them either. So the Uyghurs languished in Camp Iguana for years. In a sop to China, the US State Department added the East Turkistan Islamic Movement to its terrorist blacklist later in 2002. That would light the fuse for the disaster unfolding today for the Uyghurs. China had played its hand very well.

I used the money to rent a tiny office at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue, knowing the significance of the address would not be lost on Beijing. Even though we had only one phone and two computers, we were right next door to the White House, prompting China to instantly label us a “soft power CIA” group and to dismiss me as “just a Uyghur.”

    On one of the first nights I spent in the hotel at Guantanamo, I struck up a conversation with a military official who was also visiting. He told me that it was a mistake to bring the Uyghurs to Guantanamo, and what the US should have done was train the Uyghurs up, put them in uniform and send them back to Afghanistan to work alongside the US troops deployed there to help restore order after the fall of the Taliban. Even then, US officials recognized that these men appeared to be more potential allies than terrorists or security threats to the United States. The most powerful thing I took away from that visit was that the men I met never once complained at all about their conditions and the restrictions that they were subjected to. Instead, they seemed to be concerned about the impact that their imprisonment in Guantanamo might have on the greater Uyghur struggle for freedom.

    While living in Sweden, China sent a Uyghur man to spy on him, pretending to be a disillusioned former party official but in fact tasked with sidling up close to the exiled Uyghur leadership and spying on their movements and actions. I actually saw this same man in the south side of the US Capitol one time, casually standing next to the spokesman of the World Uyghur Congress at one of their annual meetings. We had no idea who he was until the Swedish secret service picked him up and charged him with spying on the refugee community there.

    You might think that crimes against humanity are uncovered by newspaper reporters, diplomats, human rights organizations or spies. Sometimes they are, for sure, but when the powerful governments behind an atrocity can block all access to the afflicted region, the work of unearthing the crimes can fall to a few individuals. In 1899, a young Polish seaman with ambitions to be a writer published a novella about the genocide that Belgium’s King Leopold was perpetrating in the Congo, where some eight million people were worked to death collecting rubber. Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness was listed as fiction, but it was in fact the first written testimony of the horror in Africa that was subsequently investigated and exposed thanks to his work.

    But in 2017, the menus started to change. Traditional Uyghur food was vanishing, replaced by generic kebabs and Chinese rice dishes. When Gene asked why, he was told that the Uyghur cooks and staff living in inner China were being ordered back to Xinjiang en masse, a three-to-five-day train journey from which most did not return, most likely disappearing into the camps.

    the scale of what was going on started to become apparent, Gene decided to build an online database to list Xinjiang’s missing—their names, ages, where they vanished, what they were charged with and where they were thought to be. Most important, the site had photos of many of the missing, something that brought the victims to life and humanized them, stopped them from just becoming another horrific statistic. Over the summer of 2018, Gene built the Xinjiang Victims Database, which to date has the details of more than thirteen thousand people—some of them as young as three years old—who have been “vanished” by the authorities, a fraction of the number who have actually disappeared to be sure, but a concrete base from which to gauge the staggering scale of the tragedy unfolding in Xinjiang.

    It was this persistent stonewalling in the face of mounting testimony that angered Adrian Zenz. Zenz, a German anthropologist, knew how ruthless China could be, because he had researched that very subject in Tibet. His PhD in social anthropology from Cambridge University in England had focused on how the higher education system in Chinese-occupied Tibet had shaped the ethnic identities and job opportunities of young Tibetans. His 2010 PhD thesis, “Tibetanness Under Threat,” was a rather dry and academic report, and had gone largely unnoticed at the time. But now his methodology was to prove to be downright revolutionary.

<div class="noteText">
    Zenz’s job at the time was teaching social research methods at a theological school near Stuttgart in Germany. In 2016, he presented his findings at the International Association for Tibetan Studies conference in Norway. An outsider—he is a born-again Christian who co-authored a book about the Rapture with his American father-in-law—Zenz describes himself at that event as “an exotic insect that people could maybe admire from a distance but don’t really know what it’s supposed to do.” Nevertheless, when his presentation was over he was approached by James Leibold, a professor at La Trobe University in Australia, who is an expert on China’s ethnic policies. He asked Zenz to apply his painstaking research methods to the situation in Xinjiang. Zenz once again began scouring the internet, looking for specific construction bids: the telltale elements like high walls, watchtowers, razor wire and surveillance systems to be installed. With his background in scrutinizing Tibet’s job opportunities based on educational qualifications, he also spotted what appeared to be suspiciously low educational requirements for staff in camps that purported to be offering “vocational training.” That raised the question of what the camps were really for.

    The fact that so many of the detained were successful professionals—doctors, lawyers, entertainers, professors—showed the utter absurdity of the “vocational training” lie. As for the “de-extremification” line, should Britain lock up every Muslim in the United Kingdom because a handful of extremists carried out attacks on London’s buses and Underground? Should France herd its large Muslim population into camps because some French citizens fought in Syria? No, clearly not. That is a policing matter, and what was happening in Xinjiang was something far more sinister.

    Many were simply oblivious. For young Uyghur students living overseas, the first they knew of the dawning era of repression was when they flew home to see their families during summer break of 2017. They were met at the airport not by joyful parents but by state officials, who greeted them with chilling, robotic speeches, like the scripted spiels you get from fundraisers in the US, only these were informing them that their mother and father were “in a training school set up by the government.” When these officials were met with confused, stunned faces, they continued their pre-scripted speeches, laden with menace. “I’m sure you’ll support them because this is for their own good. And for your own good.”

It was called “Clean Internet Security Soldier.” This, she was told, was an advanced spying device that would log all her calls, text messages, internet browsing, online purchases and even her GPS position: if Uyghurs left their home, they were expected to have their phone with them so the authorities knew where they were at all times.

He started to limp and grew thinner every time she saw him. Eventually, he vanished, like several other of her students. One lunchtime, when she had a chance to talk to one of the guards, Qelbinur asked what had become of Osman. The guard said he had died of a urinary tract infection, a common complaint among the prisoners, who were only allowed to use the bucket three times a day, and then only for a minute. She asked the guards what happened to the bodies of “students” who died. They said they had no idea.

Mihrigul had seen a woman start screaming hysterically, “I’m done with life, do whatever you want” before the guards came in armed with a pole fitted with a grabbing pincer at the end: they secured her by the neck with this device and dragged her off. Mihrigul never saw her again.

    That has led to numerous cases of sexual harassment and even rape. Mihrigul says that in 2016 she heard a widow in her neighborhood who lived with her twelve-year-old daughter stabbed her “relative” to death after the man sexually abused both her and her daughter. She could not go to the police to report the sexual abuse, because the state was complicit. So she stabbed the man, a defensive act that was likely registered as a knife-wielding religious extremist attack. The woman and her daughter disappeared without a trace. Silently, Mihrigul and her stepmother thanked God her father was living with them. Even so, at times her father had to sleep in one bedroom with one of the spies while another “relative”—a man—slept in the same bedroom as her and her mother. One day the two women were cooking in the kitchen when her mother heard Elina crying and went to check on the baby. The “relative” came up behind Mihrigul and groped her, trying to kiss her. She managed to push him off, then her stepmother came back. The two women tried to make sure they were never alone in their own house with these strangers. It was hard for her father, too: he knew what was going on, but was also aware that if he did or said anything there would be what the police like to call “consequences.” He had to swallow his pride and suppress his impotent rage.

    One of them was particularly troubling: a thick-set man who appeared to be in his forties and was quick to make himself at home, sitting around the living room in just his boxer shorts and undershirt. On one of his first stays, he asked her to show him how to make some of the region’s culinary specialties. As she was chopping vegetables in the kitchen, he put his hand on top of hers, as if to help, then left it there. She tried to pull her hand away but he held it tighter, then grabbed her and started kissing her. Qelbinur is a small woman, and was almost fifty at the time, and the man was large, corpulent—she still has a picture of her together with him and her husband. He is pressed horribly close to her, and though they are all awkwardly smiling in the picture, she said she had tears rolling down her cheeks. As she recounted this story to me, sitting in an asylum seekers’ refuge in the Netherlands, she was shaking and crying.

Her husband stayed in the living room. Despite him being just yards away, the man molested her. “He did everything but have sex with me,” she recalled, shuddering with tears. The man—who had told her he had a wife and child back home, wherever that might be—also complained when Qelbinur would not have oral sex with him. He said all the other Uyghur women were happy to perform such sex acts on their “relatives.” He told her he wasn’t fully satisfied, as though he were writing a Yelp review for would-be rapists.

What she had learned made her sick to her stomach, as a Uyghur woman working for the Chinese police. It was not just that the guards and police were raping women for their own pleasure, though they were. It was also that they were inserting batons—even electric batons—into their vaginas, and in the case of men, into their rectums. Prisoners were forced to perform oral sex on their captors, who would violate any orifice on a prisoner’s body—even their ears, the policewoman said. Because so many of the prisoners were young women, this camp had become a very popular posting with the guards. They had been bragging so much about how many women they had raped or abused that the police department overseeing the camp had gotten wind of it.

    Uyghurs have always been discriminated against by their mainstream Chinese rulers, be it the colonialism of the imperial Qing dynasty or the modern Communist Party. There were uprisings that briefly won some semblance of liberation—the Uzbek adventurer Yakub Beg took advantage of the chaos of the late Qing period to set up an independent state in the 1860s and early 1870s—but mostly the resistance has been quiet, subtle acts of cultural defiance carried out in the privacy of people’s homes, or in mosques or cemeteries. Instead of fighting, Uyghurs have pushed back against the encroaching Chinese culture by entrenching their own traditions, from wedding ceremonies to funeral rites, from pilgrimages to desert shrines to the observance of their own particular feasts and holidays. Now, as part of the new drive to uproot their culture in its entirety, even these last threads of memory had to be severed.

The body was that of a mullah, or religious scholar, from the city of Hormuz in Iran. He was given a proper burial in the mosque and the gold was used to finish building the shrine.

They would no longer have a personal, cultural, and spiritual history. After a few years, we would not have a memory of why we live here or where we belong.” It is hard to know if Dawut knows of the tragedy that has befallen her beloved shrines: she too has vanished into the camps.

    That sparked a series of uprisings and led to the short-lived First East Turkistan Republic being set up in 1933. It had its own flag, currency and press, but no big power backing. It survived for less than a year. It was put down by a Hui (Chinese Muslim) warlord who became a de facto Soviet puppet and who was every bit as brutal and corrupt as his predecessor. He in turn fell out with his Soviet sponsors and tried to throw in his lot with Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek (who was himself ultimately defeated by Chairman Mao) but ended up being replaced by yet another Han nationalist whose resumption of Han immigration prompted the Turkic-speaking population to rise up once again. That final revolt created the Soviet-backed Second East Turkestan Republic, which was established in 1942 and in which my grandfather served in a minor governmental role at the culture ministry.

    Casting around for a name for this burgeoning proto-nation, the intellectuals looked back into history and adopted the name of the pre-Islamic Uyghur Empire, which had fallen to the Muslim Kara-Khanid Turks more than a millennium before. The name had first been resurrected in 1910 by a local poet who dubbed himself “Child of the Uyghur,” and although the historians could probably just as easily have found their antecedents in the Kara-Khanids, the name Uyghur stuck. When Mao’s Communists won the final victory in China in 1949, Stalin handed the territory back to Beijing, and the name was taken up in turn by the Chinese Communists. They lumped it together, however, with the imperial Qing name for its “new territories,” and so the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or XUAR, was born. Despite the new name—or rather, the revived old name—the culture of the people had not changed. Their beliefs and customs remained the same, along with their romantic and poetic nature. As happened after World War I in the Middle East, very old cultures were being repackaged in modern territories: “old wine in new skins,” as one commentator put it at the time. And that is always a cause of historical friction, as the contemporary Middle East can clearly attest

    Marxism has a theory about minority languages. According to Communist theoreticians, minority languages will change slowly while remaining relatively stable, but will ultimately be replaced or assimilated by a common language. They can be tolerated “as a necessary and temporary stage before their final integration,” according to Communist dogma. That suited the leadership of the CCP, which from its founding in 1921 had adopted the Soviet model of recognizing ethnic minorities and even defending—on paper, at least—their right to secede from a federal China. In that, it hoped to distinguish itself from the imperial powers of the Qing dynasty, and from its rival Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who was pushing a policy of Hanhua, or Sinicization. Mao removed the clause allowing ethnic minorities to secede in 1938, downgrading it instead to the right to autonomy, but the constitution adopted after the CCP’s victory in 1949 still proclaimed that “all national minorities shall have the freedom to develop their dialects and languages, to preserve or reform their traditions, customs, and religious beliefs.”

They happen to be Muslim, although they speak Mandarin and are indistinguishable from other Chinese people. Listening to their stories of endless discrimination, he came to the conclusion that even if the Uyghurs really did everything the CCP demanded—gave up their language, their faith and their culture—they would never rise above the level of second-class citizens, just like the Hui.

    Back in the late 1990s, Zhu would always ask two things upon his arrival in a Uyghur community: the first was about the crops the farmers were growing, and the second was how many women were pregnant or had an IUD contraceptive device implanted. Even then, he was obsessed with Uyghur birth rates. Every town in the area had a specially adapted ambulance that would drive to Uyghur homes and force women to have an IUD implanted. If a pregnant woman was found to have had more than the allotted number of children, the same vehicle would pull up, and the crew would perform an abortion. Even though Uyghur women were allowed to have more than one child, they had to wait three years between their first and second. After the first baby was born, women were obliged to have an IUD put in. If they got pregnant before the three years were up, they would be informed that the ambulance crew was coming to perform an abortion. Anyone who tried to resist the crew—and some did—was arrested. Although Abduweli had no way of knowing it at the time, the seeds of the genocide were being sown right before his eyes: the enforced population control, the belief that Uyghurs were primitive “barbarians” whose minds needed to be exposed to China’s glorious language and culture, the anti-religious fervor and the deep-seated paranoia about separatism. It was all there, just waiting.

    One of the key differences between what happened in the last days of the European empires and what is happening in China right now is the political systems they each are embedded in. True, British and French colonial governments were often racist and prone to breaking their own laws in the face of any resistance to home rule. But Britain and France are democratic countries, with a free press and governments that change, and with civil rights organizations and independent judiciaries. Such brutal policies are bound to come to light sooner or later, and public outcry will demand that they stop. Even in 1902, the tactics against the Boers provoked outrage and public debate, and an outspoken critic of the camps, Emily Hobhouse, was granted access to them to help alleviate the suffering and report on conditions there. That is not the case in China, which does not even face any organized insurgency. True, there have been some deadly attacks, but most of them seem to have been random, carried out by individuals or small groups in response to longstanding discrimination against Uyghurs and the destruction of their holy sites. China is run by an all-powerful single party, one that has ruled unchallenged for more than 70 years now and which shows no sign of going away anytime soon. It has indoctrinated its cadres for decades, to the point that every act in Xinjiang is seen through the paranoid lens of radical Islamic terrorism, separatism or foreign interventionism. One of the reasons that we, in the outside world, know about what is going inside China is because China itself has distributed images of the “reeducation facilities.” It encourages Uyghurs to share pictures online of the Becoming Family “relatives” that are billeted on them. This is because China, much as it wants to hide its atrocities from the outside world, also very much wants the people who are being targeted to know they are being terrorized. If it is done in secret, bullying and intimidation don’t work. The fact that China’s Communist Party is unlikely to face a reckoning anytime soon makes me extremely worried about the fate of my people. Because the Soviet Union shows us that these camps can last for decades, and inflict torture, starvation and death on millions. And as we saw in Nazi Germany, if such systems survive for a long period of time, they can mutate over time into something even more deadly.
