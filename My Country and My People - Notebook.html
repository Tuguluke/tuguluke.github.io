    For on the one hand we have the northern Chinese, acclimatized to simple thinking and hard living, tall and stalwart, hale, hearty and humorous, onion-eating and fun-loving, children of nature, who are in every way more Mongolic and more conservative than the conglomeration of peoples near Shanghai and who suggest nothing of their loss of racial vigour. They are the Honan boxers, the Shantung bandits and the imperial brigands who have furnished China with all the native imperial dynasties, the raw material from which the characters of Chinese novels of wars and adventure are drawn. Down the south-east coast, south of the Yangtse, one meets a different type, inured to ease and culture and sophistication, mentally developed but physically retrograde, loving their poetry and their comforts, sleek undergrown men and slim neurasthenic women, fed on birds' nest soup and lotus seeds, shrewd in business, gifted in belles-lettres , and cowardly in war, ready to roll on the ground and cry for mamma before the lifted fist descends, offsprings of the cultured Chinese families who crossed the Yangtse with their books and paintings during the end of the Ch'in Dynasty, when China was overrun by barbaric invaders. South in Kwangtung, one meets again a different people, where racial vigour is again in evidence, where people eat like men and work like men, enterprising, carefree, spendthrift, pugnacious, adventurous, progressive and quick-tempered, where beneath the Chinese culture a snake-eating aborigines tradition persists, revealing a strong admixture of the blood of the ancient Yueh inhabitants of southern China, North and south of Hankow, in the middle of China, the loud-swearing and intrigue-loving Hupeh people exist, who are compared by the people of other provinces to “nine-headed birds in heaven” because they never say die, and who think pepper not hot enough to eat until they have fried it in oil, while the Hunan people, noted for their soldiery and their dogged persistence, offer a pleasanter variety of

    For the significant fact remains that the northerner is essentially a conqueror and the southerner is essentially a trader, and that of all the imperial brigands who have founded Chinese dynasties, none have come from south of the Yangtse. The tradition developed that no rice-eating southerners could mount the dragon throne, and only noodle-eating northerners could. In fact, with the exception of the founders of the T'ang and Chou Dynasties, who emerged from north-east Kansu and were therefore Turkish-suspect, all the founders of the great dynasties have come from a rather restricted mountainous area, somewhere around the Lunghai Railway, which includes eastern Honan, southern Hopei, western Shantung and northern Anhui.

    This is easily observable in a street car crowd or a faculty meeting, where Europeans and Chinese are placed in a row side by side. Unhygienic forms of living and the general overeating on the part of the bourgeois Chinese account, in many cases, for the drooping-shoulders and the listless eye. The constitutional differences between European and Chinese children at school age are unmistakable. On the athletic field, it is invariably found that boys who have a European father or mother distinguish themselves by their greater swiftness, agility and general exuberance of energy, while they seldom excel in tests of endurance and never in scholastic attainments.

    On good authority from medical doctors, and from references in writing, one knows that a perfectly bare mons veneris is not uncommon in Chinese women. The pores of the skin are finer than those of the Europeans, with the result that Chinese ladies, on the whole, have more delicate complexions than have European ladies, and their muscles are considerably more flabby, an ideal consciously cultivated through the institution of footbinding, which has other sex appeals.

    Perhaps the one thing that compels admiration from Westerners is our nerves. While sensitiveness is often very refined along specialized lines—the obvious proof of this is the great beauty of Chinese handicraft products in general—there seems to be a corresponding coarseness as regards response to pain and general suffering.( Arthur Smith's renowned Chinese Characteristics has a chapter on “The Absence of Comfort and Convenience” recounting his experience and observations of Chinese dress, houses, pillows and beds, which all European readers find amusing. I wager it is ten times more amusing to Chinese readers to learn of Arthur Smith's account of his sufferings and discomforts. The white man's nerves are undoubtedly degenerate.) The Chinese capacity for endurance in suffering is enormous.

    For the striking fact is that Chinese history can be conveniently divided into cycles of eight hundred years. Each cycle begins with a short-lived and militarily strong dynasty, which unified China after centuries of internal strife. Then follow four or five hundred years of peace, with one change of dynasty, succeeded by successive waves of wars, resulting soon in the removal of the capital

    The clearest effect of this ethnological mixture is perhaps to be found in the linguistic and physical traits of the modern northern Chinese, with altered tones and hardened consonants in the language, and a taller stature and a gay rustic humour in the people. It was this amalgamation of foreign blood that accounted for, to a large extent, the race's long survival.

    Among the cultural forces making for racial stability must be counted first of all the Chinese family system, which was so well-defined and organized as to make it impossible for a man to forget where his lineage belonged. This form of social immortality, which the Chinese prize above all earthly possessions, has something of the character of a religion, which is enhanced by the ritual of ancestor worship, and the consciousness of it has penetrated deep into the Chinese soul.

    Such a well-organized and religiously conceived family system was of tremendous force when the Chinese race was thrown into contact with a foreign people with a less well-defined family consciousness. Barbaric tribes or children of mixed parentage were all too anxious to join the family and claim part of the family immortality, indulging in the luxurious feeling that when one dies, one does not die, but one's self lives on in the great stream of the family life.

    A distinction may be made by saying that the Chinese are culturally old but racially young, a theory which has found support among some of the modern anthropologists. Griffith Taylor (Environment and Race , Oxford University Press, 1927) thus classifies the Chinese among the youngest strata in the evolution of the human race, according to his migration-zone scheme. Havelock Ellis also characterizes the Asiatics as being racially infantile, in the sense of retaining some of the adaptability, flexibility and pristine all-round shunp'o nature of childhood before reaching specialized development.

    The quality of patience is the result of racial adjustment to a condition where over-population and economic pressure leave very little elbow-room for people to move about, and is, in particular, a result of the family system, which is a miniature of Chinese society.

    Taoism, in theory and practice, means a certain roguish nonchalance, a confounded and devastating scepticism, a mocking laughter at the futility of all human interference and the failure of all human institutions, laws, government and marriage, and a certain disbelief in idealism, not so much because of lack of energy as because of a lack of faith. It is a philosophy which counteracts the positivism of Confucius, and serves as a safety-valve for the imperfections of a Confucian society. For the Confucian outlook on life is positive, while the Taoistic outlook is negative, and out of the alchemy of these two strange elements emerges the immortal thing we call Chinese character.( So far as this negative attitude toward life is concerned, Buddhism is merely Taoism a little touched in its -wits.)

But if he must go without that, he will not be too sorry. He wants some tall old trees in his neighbourhood, but if he cannot have them, a date-tree in his yard will give him just as much happiness. He wants many children, and a wife who personally prepares his favourite dishes; and if he is wealthy, then a good cook, too, and a pretty maidservant in red pyjamas to tend the incense while he is reading or painting. He wants some good friends, and a woman who understands, preferably to be found in the person of his wife; if not, then in one of the sing-song girls. If he is not born with such “voluptuous luck,” then he will not be sorry, either.

    Chinese humour, however, is more in deeds than in words. The Chinese have their words for the various types of humour, but the commonest type, called huach'i , in which sometimes the Confucian scholars indulge under pseudonyms, really means to me only “trying to be funny.” Such writings are only literary relaxations of a too rigoristic classical tradition, but humour as such had no proper place in literature. At least there was no open acknowledgement of the role and value of humour in literature. Humour, indeed, abounds in Chinese novels, but novels were never accepted as “literature” by the classicists.

    Indeed, the Chinese mind is akin to the feminine mind in many respects. Femininity, in fact, is the only word that can summarize its various aspects. The qualities of the feminine intelligence and feminine logic are exactly the qualities of the Chinese mind. The Chinese head, like the feminine head, is full of common sense. It is shy of abstract terms, like women's speech. The Chinese way of thinking is synthetic, concrete and revels in proverbs, like women's conversation. They never have had higher mathematics of their own, and seldom have gone beyond the level of arithmetic, like many women, with the exception of those masculine women prize-winners at college.( This refers, of course, to general womanhood as brought about by the present social system.)

The Chinese, with all their native intelligence, never developed a science of grammar, and their mathematics and astronomical knowledge have all been imported.

    Of all the ancient philosophers of the Chou Dynasty, only Motse and Hanfeitse developed a style akin to cogent reasoning. Mencius, who was undoubtedly a great sophist, cared only for such big words as “utility” and “righteousness.” All the rest of them, like Chuangtse, Liehtse and Huainantse, delighted in graceful metaphors. The disciples of Motse, Huei Shih and Kungsun Lung, who were great sophists, were interested in spinning scholastic conundrums, and in endeavouring to prove such propositions as “eggs have hair on them,” “horses lay eggs,” “a dog may be a lamb,” “a chicken has three legs,” “fire is not warm,” “the wheel never touches the ground,” “a tortoise is longer than a snake,” etc. The scholars of the Han Dynasty, which soon followed, were interested only in making Alexandrian commentaries on the classics of the preceding period. The Ch'in scholars after them revived Taoism and depended on their “intuition” for the solving of the mysteries of their own bodies and the universe. Experimentation was never thought of, and no scientific method had been developed. The Sung philosophers reinterpreted Confucianism in the light of Buddhism, and transformed it into a system of mental discipline and moral hygiene. They developed a reputation for grasping the general content of a book “without wanting to know it thoroughly.” The Sung scholars had therefore the most unscientific philology, or no philology at all. Only as late as the Ch'ing (Manchu) Dynasty was there developed a comparative method, which at once put the Ch'ing philology on a height unattained before. Ch'ing philology was the nearest approach to a scientific method in China.

    According to this theory of knowledge, truth cannot be proved, although it may be grasped by the mind in a “dialectic without words” (Chuangtse). One “knows it is so without knowing why it is so.” “Tao, or truth, is that which we know not the manner of,” It can therefore be felt only by a sort of intuitive perception. The Chinese, without all consciously accepting this Chuangtsean epistemology, essentially agree with it. Instead of relying on logic, which is never developed as a science, they rely on the perhaps healthier common sense. Anything like cogent reasoning is unknown in Chinese literature, for the Chinese inherently disbelieve in it. Consequently no dialectic has been evolved, and the scientific treatise as a literary form is unknown.

She is usually a passionate creature, for I have no doubt these stories are the wish-fulfilment of the solitary scholars. But she can bring him money and help him through poverty, by all sorts of cunning wiles. She can nurse him through sickness with more gentleness than an average modern nurse. What is stranger still, she will sometimes try to save money for him, and will wait patiently for him during his months or years of absence. She can therefore be chaste as well. The period of this cohabitation may last a few days or weeks or it may extend to a generation until she has borne him children, who, after their success ir examinations, come back for their mother and then find that the gorgeous mansion has disappeared and in its place is an old, old grave, with

Sometimes she leaves behind a note saying that she was sorry to leave them, but that she was a fox and only wanted to enjoy human life, and now, since she has seen them prosper, she is grateful and hopes they will forgive her. This is typical of the Chinese imagination which, without soaring aloft to God-like heights, invests the creatures of its mind with human passions and human sorrows. It has the pagan virtue of accepting the imaginary with the real, and has no desire for a world perfectly rationalized and completely explained.

Iconoclasts have really nothing to do when they enter a Confucian temple. In the Confucian and ancestral temples there are merely oblong wooden tablets, inscribed with characters bearing the names of the spirits they represent, having as little resemblance to idols as a calendar block. And in any case, these ancestral spirits are not gods, but merely human beings who have departed but who continue to take an interest in their progeny as they did in their lifetime.

    The Confucian conception of man's place in nature is that “Heaven, earth and man” are regarded as “the three geniuses of the universe.” This is a distinction somewhat corresponding to the Babbittian threefold distinction of supernaturalism, humanism and naturalism. Heaven is seen as consisting of the clouds, the stars, and all those unknowable forces which Western legal phraseology sums up as “acts of God,” while the earth is seen as consisting of mountains and rivers and all those forces ascribed in Greek mythology to Demeter, and man occupies an all-important place between the two.

    It is this spirit of reasonableness which has given birth to the Doctrine of the Golden Mean, the central doctrine of Confucianism. Reference has already been made in the preceding chapter to the spirit of reasonableness, as contrasted with logic or reason itself. It has been shown there that the spirit of reasonableness is largely intuitive and practically identical with English common sense. It has been further shown that for a Chinese it is not enough that a proposition be “logically correct”; it is much more important that it be “in accord with human nature.”

One philosopher, Motse, taught the love of all men, and another, Yang Chu, taught the love of oneself, and Mencius condemned them both, merely saying: “Love your own parents.” It was such a sensible thing to say.

    There are other deficiencies in Confucianism also. It has too much realism and too little room for fancy and imagination. And the Chinese are childishly imaginative. Something of that youthful wonder which we call magic and superstition remains in the Chinese breast. Confucianism provides for the existence of spirits, but takes care to keep them at a distance. It recognizes the spirits of the mountains and the rivers, and even symbolically those of human ancestors, but it has no heaven and hell, no hierarchy of gods and no cosmogony, and its rationalism shows little interest in magic and the pill of immortality. Even the realistic Chinese, apart from their rationalistic scholars, always have a secret desire for immortality. Confucianism has no fairies, while Taoism has. In short, Taoism stands for the childish world of wonder and mystery for which Confucianism fails to provide.

    Women, in short, had become the playthings of men. Shih Ts'ung, who had dozens of concubines, used to make them tread on a bed spread with rare incense powder and those who were light enough to leave no footprint on it would be rewarded with strings of pearl necklaces, while those who did would be “put on the diet” and instructed to reduce. Those pearl necklaces, rather than Confucianism, were the cause of women's downfall in China as in ancient Rome or modern New York. The situation was therefore ripe for the institution of footbinding, which was the last sophistication of male fancy.

    “Public spirit” is a new term, so is “civic consciousness”, and so is “social service”. There are no such commodities in China. To be sure, there are “social affairs,” such as weddings, funerals, and birthday celebrations and Buddhistic processions and annual festivals. But the things which make up English and American social life, viz., sport, politics and religion, are conspicuously absent. There is no church and no church community. The Chinese religiously abstain from talking politics; they do not cast votes, and they have no club-house debates on politics. They do not indulge in sport, which binds human beings together, and which is the essence of the English and American social life. They play games, to be sure, but these games are characteristic of Chinese individualism. Chinese games do not divide the players into two parties, as in cricket with one team playing against the other. Team work is unknown. In Chinese card games, each man plays for himself. The Chinese like poker, and do not like bridge. They have always played mahjong, which is nearer to poker than to bridge. In this philosophy of mahjong may be seen the essence of Chinese individualism.

    The conflict is between the family mind and the social mind. If one scratches deep enough, one always finds the family mind at work. For the family system is the root of Chinese society, from which all Chinese social characteristics derive. The family system and the village system, which is the family raised to a higher exponent, account for all there is to explain in the Chinese social life. Face, favour, privilege, gratitude, courtesy, official corruption, public institutions, the school, the guild, philanthropy, hospitality, justice, and finally the whole government of China—all spring from the family and village system, all borrow from it their peculiar tenor and complexion, and all find in it enlightening explanations for their peculiar characteristics. For from the family system there arises the family mind, and from the family mind there arise certain laws of social behaviour. It will be interesting to study these and see how man behaves as a social being in the absence of a social mind.

    Confucianism is actually known as ming chiao , or “religion of names.” A name is a title that gives a man his definite status in any society and defines his relationships with others. Without a name, or a definition of the social relationship, a man would not know his duty, or duties in that relationship, and hence would not know how to behave. The Confucian idea is that if every man knows his place and acts in accordance with his position, social order will be ensured. Of the “five cardinal human relationships,” four are occupied with the family. They are the relationships between king and subject, between father and son, between husband and wife, and those between brothers and between friends. The last relationship between friends may be identified with the family, because friends are those who can be included in the family circle—family friends.” The family

The movement of Communism, with its ruthless stand against the gentry and the local rich, and constantly growing and feeding upon the dislocated population, now homeless, fatless, and marrowless and being called “bandits,” must be looked upon as an economic rebellion of the people, quite apart from the accident of Russian theories.

The only way to keep the officials clean is to threaten to shoot them when they are caught. Officials who feel hurt at my legalist view of human nature should reflect a little whether they would be willing to invest money in a stock company run strictly on the Confucian-gentlemanly principle, with no possibility of attesting an absconding treasurer or manager.

    The Chinese make a distinction between literature that instructs and literature that pleases, or literature that is “the vehicle of truth” and literature that is “the expression of emotion” The distinction is easy to see: the former is objective and expository, while the latter is subjective and lyrical. They all pretend that the former is of greater value than the latter, because it improves the people's minds and uplifts society's morals. From this point of view, they look down upon novels and dramas as “little arts, unworthy to enter the Hall of Great Literature.” The only exception is poetry, which they not only do not despise but cultivate and honour more intensively and generally than in the West.

    By comparison with the European languages it is possible to trace how much of the peculiarities of Chinese thought and literature are due simply to their possession of a so-called monosyllabic language. The fact that the Chinese spoke in syllables like ching , chon g, chang was appalling in consequences. This monosyllabism determined the character of the Chinese writing, and the character of the Chinese writing brought about the continuity of the literary heritage and therefore even influenced the conservatism of Chinese thought. It was further responsible for the development of a literary language quite distinct from the spoken language. This, in turn, made learning difficult and necessarily the privilege of a limited class. Finally, the monosyllabism directly influenced the development of certain peculiarities of Chinese literary style.

    Whereas a phonetic script would follow naturally the changes and idioms of a living language, the language of written symbols, by being less dependent upon sounds, achieved a greater freedom in idiom and grammar. It did not have to obey the laws of any spoken language, and, in time, it had its laws of structure and a store of idioms which accumulated by literary accidents from the works of different dynasties. Thus it came to have an independent reality of its own, subject more or less to literary fashions.

Thus, in the spoken language we require a bisyllabic lao hu (“ old tiger”) to distinguish it aurally from a dozen other hu' s, but in writing, the character hu alone is sufficient. The literary language is therefore much more monosyllabic than the spoken language, since its basis is visual and not aural.

    The consequent difficulty of this literary craft caused the limitation of literacy in China, which needs no elaboration. The limitation of literacy in turn changed the whole organization of Chinese society and the whole complexion of Chinese culture, and one sometimes wonders whether the Chinese people as a whole would be so docile and so respectful to their superiors had they spoken an inflexional language and consequently used an alphabetic language. I sometimes feel that, had the Chinese managed to retain a few more final or initial consonants in their language, not only would they have shaken the authority of Confucius to its foundations, but very possibly would have long ago torn down the political structure and, with the general spread of knowledge

But he also succeeded in ordering the complete or partial destruction of about 2,000 books, involving about a score of cases of dismissal from office, imprisonment, flogging or death of the authors, sometimes including the destruction of their ancestral temples and the selling of their family as slaves—all this because of the misuse of a word.

The Classics Division includes the classics and classic philology, which waste the greater part of Chinese scholars' time. The History Divison includes dynastic histories, special histories, biography, miscellaneous records, geography (including travel sketches and local history of districts or famous mountains), civil service system, laws and statutes, bibliography, and historical criticism. The Philosophy Division originally borrowed its name from the schools of philosophy of the Chou Dynasty, but was made to include all the special arts and sciences of China (as in the “Faculty of Philosophy” of a

Astronomy, apart from the works of Jesuit disciples, is very near astrology, and zoology and botany are very near cuisine, since so many of the animals and fruits and vegetables are eatable. Medicine usually occupies the same shelf in ordinary book stores as necromancy and fortune-telling. Psychology, sociology, engineering, and political economy are hidden all over among the notebooks, and writers whose books get into the classification of botany and zoology in the Philosophy Division or Miscellaneous Records in the History Division achieve that distinction by the more specialized nature of their notes, but, with the exception of outstanding works, do not essentially depart from the notebooks in the Literature Division in spirit and technique.

    It is natural that the bondage of language has brought with it the bondage of thought. The literary language was dead, so dead that it could not express an exact thought. It always lost itself in vague generalities. Brought up amidst such generalities, with a total lack of discipline in logical reasoning, Chinese scholars often displayed an extreme childishness of argument. This disparity between thought and literature brought about a situation where thought and literature were regarded as having no relation with one another.

    In order to understand Chinese politics, one should understand Chinese literature. Perhaps one should here avoid the word literature (wenhsuek ) and speak of belles-lettres (wenchang ). This worship of belles-lettres as such has become a veritable mania in the nation. This is clearest in modern public statements, whether of a student body, a commercial concern, or a political party. In issuing such public statements, the first thought is how to make them nice-sounding, how to word them beautifully. And the first thought of a newspaper reader is whether such statements read nicely or not. Such statements almost always say nothing,, but almost always say it beautifully. A palpable lie is praised if it is told in good form.

    This has led to a type of belles-lettre s which, when translated into English, seems extremely silly. Thus in a comparatively recent statement by an important political party we read: “Whoever violates our national sovereignty and invades our territory, we will drive them out! Whoever endangers the peace of the world, we will stop them! We are determined. . , . We are resolved to exert our utmost, . . . We must unite together ” A modern public would refuse to accept such a statement. They would require a more exact analysis of the foreign and domestic political situation of the moment and a more detailed account of the ways and means by which they are going to “drive out” the invaders and “stop” the breakers of international peace. This literary malpractice is sometimes carried to stupid extremes, as when a commercial advertisement for silk stockings takes the form of a long five-hundred-word essay, beginning with “Since the Manchurian provinces have been lost ”

    That does not mean, however, that the Chinese people are simple-minded. Their literature is full of generalities, but it is not simple. Rather on the contrary, from this hedging about the problems and these vague generalities of expression, there has developed, strange to say, the utmost finesse of expression. The Chinese, versed in this literary training, have learned to read between the lines, and it is the foreigners’ inability to read between the lines, or the fault of the bad translators in missing the “meaning beyond the words” (as we say in Chinese) that causes the foreign correspondents to curse both China and themselves for their inability to make head or tail of such cleverly-worded and apparently harmless public statements.

    A modern Chinese, seeing the performance of such a literary atrocity, can only do either of two things. First, he can take the traditional view of literature and blandly regard it as pure belles-lettre s, which need have no correlation with the facts which the writing is supposed to convey—and then read between the lines. Or he must demand a closer approximation between words and thought and a new literary standard, with a language more capable of expressing man's life and thoughts. In other words, he must regard the prevalence of such verbose statements as a malpractice more of a literary than of a political origin. But he must also believe that unless such literary malpractices are weeded out, political malpractices must also follow.

    Further, there is a relation between Chinese language and poetry. Poetry should be crisp, and the Chinese language is crisp. Poetry should work by suggestion, and the Chinese language is full of contractions which say more than what the words mean. Poetry should express ideas by concrete imagery, and the Chinese language revels in word-imagery. Finally, the Chinese language, with its clear-cut tones and its lack of final consonants, retains a sonorous singing quality which has no parallel in non-tonal languages, Chinese prosody is based on the balance of tonal values, as English poetry is based on accent.

Most intellectual leaders had learned to keep quiet and started collecting curios and old seals.

Chinese science, in any case, does not make any pretensions, although the Chinese empirical medicine provides a rich field for medical research and discoveries. Chinese philosophy will never make any lasting impression on the West, because Chinese philosophy, with its moderation, restraint and pacifism, which are all physically conditioned by the decrease of bodily energy, can never suit the Western temperament, with its aggressive exuberance and vitality.

I have seen a few examples of European Buddhist monks, who talk altogether too loudly and too vehemently to conceal the tumultuous passions in their souls. In particular, I have seen one who, in his energetic denunciation of the West, is willing to call down fire and brimstone from heaven to burn up all Europe.

    If they had known any taste for food their language would reveal it. The English language does not provide a word for cuisine: they call it just “cooking.” They have no proper word for chef; they just call him a cook. They do not speak about their menu, but know only what are called “dishes.” And they have no word for gourmet: they just call him “Greedy Gut” in their nursery rhymes. The truth is, the English do not admit that they have a stomach. No stomach is fit for conversation unless it happens to be “sick” or “aching.” The result is that while the Frenchman will talk about the cuisine of his chef with—what seems to the English mind—immodest gestures, the Englishman can hardly venture to talk about the “food” of his “cook” without impairing the beauty of his language.

    This seems unlikely until China has built a few good gun-boats and can punch the West in the jaw, when it will be admitted that we are unquestionably better cooks as a nation. But until that time comes, there is no use talking about it. There are thousands of Englishmen in the Shanghai Settlement who have never stepped inside a Chinese restaurant, and the Chinese are bad evangelists. We never force salvation on anybody who does not come to ask for it. We have no gunboats, anyway, and even if we had, we would never care to go up the Thames or the Mississippi and shoot the English or the Americans into heaven against their will.

Custom and convention, which are the mainstay of any society, are no longer held in honour; the old can no longer command the respect of the young, and the young grow over-critical of the old; a deep chasm exists between the growing generation and mature age. Culture, which is the fruit of a continuity of life and thought, is no longer possible, and criticism, which is the sole guardian of modern culture, and which should keep a watchful eye over the flux of life, lies prostrate before a task too big for itself, while cheerful, robust good sense, for which China was so distinguished, buries its head in shame, Man has something

    history reveals and the Confucian theory of imitation affirms that in times of national crisis it is the great men who change the destiny of a nation.

    Yet I remember how Japan passed through the same phase of militarism, triumphantly led by a great man, Prince Ito. But then, you may say, Japan is small, and one can lay the blame to the size of our nation. Then I remember the example of Russia, with the size of half a continent, and peopled with a peasantry just as poor and illiterate as the Chinese people, and a bourgeoisie just as indifferent and a gentry just as corrupt. Yet there was vigour in those old bones, and Old Russia shook off its old carcass and emerged the youngest child of the family of nations, radiant with hope and energy. And I say, Bah! with the materialistic dialectic! For if the times have sinned against the great men in China, the great men have sinned more against the times. The search for causes always leads back to a search for leadership, for courageous and honest leadership, for with Confucius I believe that great men, by their example, can change the whole morale of a nation, as Prince Ito did in Japan.

But that, too, I give up? for aeroplanes are making Village Socialism impossible, and the family solidarity and the village solidarity have been broken up. I cannot accept democracy in the sense of parliamentarism, for I know full well that a Chinese M.P. is not an M, P.; he cannot be if he is a Chinese, for an M.P. in China is an “official,” too, in the most pathetic sense of the word, and we have too many of them, so why bother to elect them at the cost of five thousand dollars a ticket, for which we will eventually have to pay? Nor can I accept, for that matter, any ism, for I have seen how foreign isms, even the most fast-dyed and fadeless kind, lose colour in a Chinese laundry, and give off only a stinking laundry steam odour. Nor can I accept another revolution, for I have heard the familiar boom of guns and the racket of fusillades, and they have ceased to scare me now, for the boom of guns soon ceased and the racket that sounded like a fusillade seemed more and more like firecrackers in the next street, and I learned that it was only Mr. Yang celebrating his assumption of a new post.

    for two thousand years, has not yet rescued itself from rampant official corruption and heartless oppression of the people. Besides, the moral uplifter, as I have pointed out, is a selfish man, not only because he wants to uplift other people's morality but because he is avoiding going to jail himself. He would have to go to jail if he stopped preaching moral uplift and began talking a government by law. The moral uplifter erects a pailou in honour of other moral uplifters after their death, if they turn out to be gentlemen, but inevitably fails to send other moral uplifters to prison if they turn out, as most of them do, to be thieves. And what he does not do unto others he does not want done unto himself. Therein lie the gaiety and pleasantness of Moral Upliftism.
