    The term was coined by sociologist Arlie Hochschild. She described emotional labor as the need to “induce or suppress feelings to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others.”

<div class="noteText">
    emotional labor is the effort required to stay within an emotional regime. Emotional labor exists because emotional regimes are top-down, imposed from some sort of higher authority, often the state but sometimes religions, philosophical beliefs, or the moral codes we are raised to adhere to.

    Most of us know him by his nickname, Broad—or, to use the ancient Greek version, Plato.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

    The Greeks called emotions pathē, meaning “experience” or “suffering.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 13 · Location 193
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    What confused Plato was how on earth people could feel two different emotions at once. How could someone feel both terrified and brave at the same time, desiring to fight while wanting to flee, for example, like soldiers in a battle? The answer he arrived at was that we have more than one part to our souls.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 13 · Location 196

    That was Plato’s lógos—a type of soul that can reason, know, understand. Plato called the soul that animals have the epithumêtikon, a word that means “desiring” or “appetitive.”

    He called this third part of the soul thumoeides, or thymos—the “spirited soul.” 6 Thymos translates as “anger,” and it’s in this part of the soul where you find the feelings that get stuff done.

    This reason-free drive toward pleasure is called boulesis. Boulesis is not virtuous, because sometimes doing the right thing is painful and doing evil things can give you pleasure.

<div class="noteText">
    One of the most significant differences between Plato and Aristotle is that Aristotle didn’t think emotions needed to be suppressed for the greater good—at least not in the lofty, almost spiritual, way that Plato did. If you were going to control your emotions, Aristotle thought, it should be to use them in a debate style called rhetoric. Rhetoric is the art of persuasion, and at its core is something called pathos, or the ability to draw out the feelings of the people to whom you are speaking. It’s a type of argumentation that politicians and lawyers still rely on today, perhaps too often.

    he ends book 1 with the two primary emotions that he thinks all the others come from. • The first is pleasure, which he defines as “a movement by which the soul as a whole is consciously brought into its normal state of being”—in other words, an unperturbed soul. Pleasure is associated with those feelings that help the soul go back to being unperturbed. 23 • The second is pain—the opposite of pleasure, or a perturbed soul. Pain is associated with the feelings that cause the ripples in the first place. 24
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 23 · Location 355
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Aristotle’s list of emotional pairs useful for rhetoric is: • anger/ calm; 25 • friendship/ enmity (or love/ hate); 26 • fear/ confidence (the latter is described as “the absence or remoteness of what is terrible: it may be due either to the near presence of what inspires confidence or to the absence of what causes alarm”); 27 • shame/ shamelessness; 28 • kindness/ unkindness; ii29 • pity/ indignation; 30 and • envy/ emulation (the latter is described as a sort of good envy—feeling pleased when somebody has gotten or achieved something).

<div class="noteText">
    To Plato, feelings could either raise us to a greater good or condemn us to dangerous short-term pleasures. Aristotle thought emotions sprang from a part of the soul we share with animals and that they were useful when arguing or negotiating with an enemy. Both believed that emotions could be manipulated by reason, or lógos. Plato thought emotions should be directed toward something high, something spiritual, while Aristotle thought of them in a practical, down-to-earth way, as a tool for getting things done. Pretty much every disagreement between these two men can be boiled down to Plato’s emphasis on the spiritual versus Aristotle’s pragmatic focus on real-world applications. Their views on emotion are certainly no different.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 29 · Location 448

<div class="noteText">
    Most of those feelings—happiness, calm, fear, panic, and relief—were caused by the world around you affecting your senses.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 30 · Location 454

    while most feelings are “world-to-brain”—that is, we sense something in the world, and it creates feelings inside us—desire is “brain-to-world.” We feel desire, then we do something.

    The first is motivational desire: the desire to get up and do things. The second is hedonic desire: the desire to experience pleasure and avoid pain. Finally, there is learning desire: the desire to learn through experience what will be good for us and what will not.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 32 · Location 487
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In many Hindu scriptures there are four types of desire, or aims (purusarthas). The most important of these is each person’s path, or dharma. Dharma is both a motivational and a learning desire.

    You have to ignore the bhavas that try to tempt you away from it. Bhavas are complicated. The word bhava can mean both “existing” and “being created”—life and birth. It can also refer to a mood, feeling, or habit. And it can mean all these things at the same time.

<div class="noteText">
    Although dharma is the most important desire to follow, it’s not the only one. The next is artha. This is a motivational desire for the things you need to live your life.

    The third desire is kama. Kama is not to be mistaken for karma. Karma is a summation of your deeds across this and previous lifetimes. It governs whether, how, and into what you will be reincarnated. Kama, however, is a hedonic desire for worldly pleasures.

<div class="noteText">
    Most Hindus believe that we are made up of our true selves—the atman and its surrounding five sheaths, or kosha. The atman is part of Brahman—a Hindu word for God. Put simply, to know your true self is to know that bit of you that is also part of God, or that bit of yourself that’s godlike. This might sound a bit like lógos, but whereas the lógos is accessed through thinking, the atman is harder to reach because it lies beyond thought. To get to the atman you have to work your way through the kosha, comprising the following layers.

    Even if you get everything you want, greed (lobha), anger (krodha), envy (matsarya), and fear (bhaya) will plague you every step of the way. Always wanting more and fearing the loss of what you have will lead you, ultimately, to suffering in this life or the next. To achieve real bliss, you have to balance those desires, follow your dharma, and fulfill moksha.

    known as the Four Noble Truths, the first three of which we’ve already met. 1. There is suffering. 2. The cause of suffering is desire. 3. The way out of suffering is through nirvana (or, in Hinduism, connecting to your bliss sheath). 8 So far so good. But the last noble truth was something unique: there is a path to nirvana. This path came to be known as the Noble Eightfold Path. Sometimes the Eightfold Path is split into three divisions. The first division is basically about becoming a Buddhist, and the second is about being a good person. The third division is the one that gets you to nirvana, and it’s all about desire. Or at least something like it.

    It’s about not dwelling on the past or dreaming of the future; it’s about being in the “moment.” Ancient Buddhist practitioners of mindfulness achieved this through a mastery over what they called the Five Aggregates of Clinging, or skandhas.

    Chanda is central to Buddhism. It’s a desire that helps you follow the Eightfold Path by keeping clinging at bay. To put it another way, in a strange twist on second-order desires, chanda is a desire not to desire.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 42 · Location 655
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The good news is that Buddha taught everyone how to master chanda. You begin by sticking to step number 6 in the Eightfold Path—right effort. Replace greed with gladness at others’ success (mudita). Throw away hate and restore loving-kindness (metta) and compassion (karuna). Then move to the seventh step, right mindfulness. Move away from the delusion of existence and surround yourself with the Buddhist insight (punna, vipassana) that—in contrast to Hindu beliefs—there is no true self. In fact, there’s no self at all. Once you’ve managed that, you are ready to take the final step—right samadhi, a particularly deep form of meditation that can lead to nirvana.

    To the Hebrews, emotions were visceral. The heart was the seat of the will, the intellect, and certain feelings, such as kindness. The kidneys, kilyot, were vessels responsible for the deepest emotions of the soul. It’s there where you experience the gut feeling you have when something just isn’t right. The liver, ka’veid, was the seat of glory and honor. The nose, aph, took its name from anaph—meaning “breathing heavily” or “snorting in rage.”

    Frui is the route to heaven and to God. According to Augustine, the aim isn’t heaven per se. The aim is to reach God. He is the finis, or telos: the end; the goal.

    The relationship between love and wisdom might seem a little strange. It comes, once again, from Augustine’s reading of Plato. Plato understood love as a ladder. The bottom rung was a love of beauty and the physical—lust, you might say. In the middle of the ladder was a love for all parts of a person’s soul, what modern science might call affection. Then, at the top of the ladder, was what Augustine would call frui. That’s love not for the physical but for wisdom, virtue, and the divine—a love of genuine good. It’s the love that Plato thought could guide you to eros. Some philosophers even argue that eros is love, but to me, it refers to the place you’re going rather than what gets you there.

    The Koran mentions ten types of fear, including khawf (the fear of a danger you see coming and should prepare for), khashiyah (the fear of the harm something can do to you), and taqwa (the type of fear that leads you to take precautions, such as locking your house or wearing a mask during a pandemic).

    We’ve considered pathē: perturbations in the soul brought about when the senses detect something that might cause pleasure or pain. We’ve considered passions: feelings very similar to pathē that are felt in the sensitive part of the soul and that can influence the rational soul if you let them. And we’ve considered sentiments: feelings that help us with moral actions or aesthetic judgments.
