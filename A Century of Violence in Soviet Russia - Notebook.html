    Yakovlev’s critiques of the Soviet system will not be easy to discredit. He is neither a pampered Western intellectual in search of a cause nor a defector who can be accused of having been bought off by Western lucre. It will be interesting to see the response of those who find it hard to stomach his conviction that Marxism, too, bears significant responsibility for the human toll exacted by Communist systems.

    The land of Rus accepted Christianity from Constantinople in a.d. 988. Characteristics of Byzantine rule of that era—baseness, cowardliness, venality, treachery, overcentralization, apotheosis of the ruler’s personality—dominate in Russia’s social and political life to this day. In the twelfth century the various fragmented Russian principalities ... were conquered by the Mongols. Asian traditions and customs, with their disregard for the individual and for human rights and their cult of might, violence, despotic power, and lawlessness became part of the Russian people’s way of life. The tragedy of Russia lay first and foremost in this: that for a thousand years it was ruled by men and not by laws.. .. They ruled ineptly, bloodily. The people existed for the government, not the government for the people. Russia avoided classical slavery. But it has not yet emerged from feudalism; it is still enslaved by an official imperial ideology, the essence of which is that the state is everything and the individual nothing.

    Yakovlev writes: “The Bolshevik regime is guilty not only of the deaths of millions of people and the tragic consequences for theit families, not only of creating an atmosphere of total fear and lies, but of a crime against conscience, of producing its notorious ‘new historic community of people’ distorted by malice, doublethink, suspiciousness, and pretense. Lenin and Stalin and their henchmen ... destroyed the nation’s gene pool, . . . undermining the potential for the flowering of science and culture.”

    I also began to understand how developments in Russia had been determined by another aspect of Marxism. As a practical-minded heir to Marx’s utopian visions and as a master at translating all kinds of theoretical schemes into political prose, Lenin had extracted from Marx’s highly contradictory projects only those elements that answered to his main purpose—the seizure of power.

    Vladimir Ilyich Ulianov (Lenin): Chairman of the first Soviet government after the violent seizure of power in 1917. Exponent of mass terror, violence, the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle, and other inhuman concepts. Organizer of the fratricidal Russian civil war and the concentration camps, including camps for children. Incessant in his demands for arrests and capital punishment by bullet or rope. Personally responsible for the deaths of millions of Russian citizens. By every norm of international law, posthumously indictable for crimes against humanity. Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (Stalin): Organizer of mass arrests of millions of innocent victims. Architect of the gulag system for totally destroying human life. Carried on with Lenin’s criminal project for wholesale extermination of peasants, the intelligentsia, the clergy, and all other “alien class elements.” Inventor of a whole category of “enemies of the people” subject to annihilation along with their families. Directly responsible for the country’s unpreparedness for war with Nazi Germany and the resultant deaths of almost thirty million people. Shares responsibility with Lenin for the division of the peoples of Russia into hostile camps, producing a state of constant civil war. Organizer of the democide of the Russian and other peoples of the USSR. By every norm of international law, posthumously indictable for crimes against humanity.

    On occasion, when the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) would submit a list of those for whom it recommended prison sentences, Molotov would write the letters VMN, meaning capital punishment, next to some of the names. The emendations were enough to cause these persons to be shot.

    Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov: Authorized the elimination of the top officers and political workers of the Red Army. The purge in the 1930s eliminated 3 of the army’s 5 marshals, 15 of the 16 army commanders, 60 of the 67 corps commanders, 136 out of 199 division commanders, all 4 of the navy’s top flag officers, all 6 of its first-ranking flag officers, and 6 of its 15 second-ranking flag officers. All 17 of the army’s first-and second-ranking commissars were shot, along with 25 of the 29 commissars at the corps level. Voroshilov’s tenure as people’s commissar of defense saw the arrest, in 1936-40 alone, of more than 3 6,000 middle-and top-level Red Army officers. The files of the Federal Security Service (FSB) contain more than 300 cases of prominent army commanders arrested at Voroshilov’s behest. As World War II approached, the country’s armed forces were, for all intents and purposes, decapitated.

    As early as January 1918, only two months after his counterrevolutionary coup, Lenin would write approvingly: “In one place, they will jail ten or so moneybags, a dozen crooks, a half dozen workers who shirk their duties (in the same sloppy way as many typesetters in Petersburg do, especially in the Party’s printing shops). In another place, they will make them clean out the toilets. In a third, the people will keep an eye on them as harmful until they reform. In a fourth, one out of ten of those guilty of parasitism will be shot on the spot. In a fifth, they will think up a combination of various measures” (italics mine).

    Reform in the USSR and in Russia turned out to be a difficult process politically and economically, and even more so psychologically. In trying to reform the country we, and here I include myself, underestimated a great deal—above all, the psychological condition of the society, which turned out to be more inert, indifferent, and dependent than we had imagined. To this day, many people pin their hopes on some great man, some idol, and dream of slavery and “stronger” leaders. There you are: the “riddle” of the Russian soul. In actual fact, nothing more than a slave psychology.

    Today, many of the children of the concentration camps are getting on in years. They are war veterans, pensioners. Their parents did not live long enough to see the changes leading to a democratic Russia. And the time is not far off when these former “Stalinist orphans” will be the only surviving witnesses to the tragic events and crimes of the fascist regime. And then they, too, will be gone. The Commission on the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, which reports to the president of Russia and which I head, has quite a few letters from the young prisoners of the past. They write that to this day they dream of the horrors of the gulag, to this day they search for their parents. They live and remember. Their memories are their lifelong cross.

    A litmus test for any government, however it may disguise itself, is its treatment of children. Yes, the Soviet Union had its sunny Artek youth camp as an advertisement for happy childhood; it had its Young Pioneers and its trips to summer camps at discounted prices. But it also had its gulag concentration camps, and its itineraries for those exiled to Siberia, and its travel papers from the agency of Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria. Repressive action against children is the lowest depth of the inhumanity of Bolshevik fascism. Nothing is more despicable than a government that wars on the young with all its punitive might.

    The well-known theoretician of anarchism Prince Kropotkin is quite fair in his verdict on that sanguinary “invention” of the Bolsheviks, taking children as hostages. In a letter to Lenin in December 1920, he called the Bolshevik leaders’ use of hostages, no less than their resort to mass executions, unworthy of men undertaking the construction of a new society. The prince thought his voice would be heard. But Lenin scrawled on the letter: “To the archive ...”

    And yet, in dealing with the victims of political repression, our lawmakers for some reason distinguish between parents and children. The parents were repressed, the argument goes, but the children only suffered in consequence.

    I don’t even want to comment on these ravings. Can it really be that the Russian people will never pull themselves out of the gutter into which politicians burdened neither by conscience nor by feeling for their homeland dragged them in 1917? Once again we exclaim over the past and ask ourselves, “Was it possible?” And off we go again like a herd of cattle stampeding toward the slaughterhouse. We Russians have a very short memory. Perhaps because too much sorrow has befallen us, the road of suffering has been inordinately long.

    “The lust for power of this band of adventurers turned out to be so strong,” the Menshevik M. Liber wrote of the Bolsheviks in 1918, “that in the struggle to hold on to it they did not shrink from any kind of crime.” 20

    The conditions put forward by Lenin were so harsh that they were more like ultimatums, and they made it crystal clear that the Bolsheviks did not have the slightest wish to share power with anybody. “You will have good-neighborly relations with us,” Lenin told the socialists, “and we will have the state power. We’ll be happy to legalize you, Messrs. Mensheviks. But... we will keep state power in our hands, and in our hands alone. Not the smallest portion of it will we yield.”

    THE DESPOTISM of the authorities during the postwar period of devastation and hunger fell heaviest on the peasants. In the first place, they had grain, which had to be confiscated, and in the second plape, they were automatically regarded as opponents of the new regime since, according to Marxist dogma, they were constantly recreating the world of the petty bourgeoisie and its private-property outlook.

    The Red Army itself, in Lenin’s words, was created nine-tenths “for systematic military operations for taking and retaking, collecting and delivering grain and fuel.” 1 Note well: for systematic military operations. Developing their “plan for going after grain with machine guns,” the Bolsheviks pursued basically political objectives.

    For years the formula “Stalin is the Lenin of today” was hammered into the heads of the Soviet people. It was Stalin’s own brainchild. This formula, unlike most others of the time, is accurate and fair. Stalin indeed turned out to be a worthy pupil of Lenin’s in his hatred and in his taste for blood. He not only carried on doggedly with Lenin’s criminal endeavors but completed the destruction of the peasant class in the dreadful years of collectivization and dekulakization, the most tragic in Russia’s history. To the sound of executions by rifle and machine gun, the country entered a frightful phase of its development, comparable perhaps only to the years of World War II.

    THE MILLS of terror seized not only on social classes and groups—the peasantry, the nobility, Cossacks, merchants, the army, the clergy—but on whole peoples, who were forcibly deported to the far north and Siberia, to Kazakhstan and Central Asia. In the tragic fate of Poles, Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans, Chechens, Ingush, Kalmyks, Balkars, Karachayevs, Turko-Meskhetins, Khemshins, Koreans, Finns, Ingermanlanders, as well as Armenians, Bulgarians, Gagauzys, Greeks, Kurds, and many others, Bolshevik fascism revealed itself in perhaps its most transparent form, exposing the chauvinist basis of its policy. Long hidden in archives, documents tracing Bolshevism’s crimes against these many people now make it possible to present the full sweep of the tragedy of Soviet society’s degradation.

    Among the first acts of deportation was the resettlement of “unreliable elements” in areas bordering on Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkey. On 17 July 1937 the TsIK and the SNK passed a decree creating special restricted areas. And immediately 1,325 Kurds were moved from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, and Tadzhikistan into the interior of the country. All told, forty regions were swept clean.

    After this came the expulsion, starting on 28 December 1943. It was carried out by more than 7,000 operatives and 29,000 military personnel. The Kalmyks were exiled not only from Kalmykia but from the Rostov and Stalingrad oblasts and the Stavropolsk region. The number of exiles came to 99,252. In mid-April 1944 preparations got under way for deporting the Crimean Tatars. Utilizing some 20,000 military personnel and 8,000 operatives of the NKVD, the operation began at dawn on 18 May and was completed on 20 May. Almost 200,000 people were exiled. The expulsion of Bulgarians (12,975), Armenians (9,919), and Greeks (14,300) from the Crimea began on 26 May. Among the autonomous entities of the northern Caucasus, the Chechen-Ingush Republic had the largest population. On the eve of the war its twenty-four regions were home to 731,400 persons, including 387,800 Chechens, 75,000 Ingush, and 205,000 Russians.

    On 23 February, Beria reported to Stalin that “the operation for exiling the Chechens and Ingush began at dawn. The exiling is proceeding normally. No significant incidents. There were six cases of individual resistance, blocked by arrests or use of armed force.” Beria updated Stalin almost daily on the progress of this barbaric operation. On 1 March he told him: “As of 29 February, 478,479 persons, including 91,250 Ingush, have been exiled and loaded onto trains. Altogether 177 echelons have been loaded, and of these 157 have been sent off to the resettlement areas.” 11

    Nor did the operation end here. It spread to include Chechens and Ingush demobilized from the Red Army (after February 1944). Orders went out to all the fronts. Thus, instructions addressed to chairmen of the screening committees stipulated that “all Karachayevs, Chechens, Ingush, and Balkars are to be transferred to the jurisdiction of the special-resettlement branches of the NKVD in the Kazakh SSR—to Alma Ata.” According to the NKVD, the number of special exiles who had served in the army from the northern Cau-cusus came to 8,896 (710 officers, 1,698 sergeants, 6,488 privates), and of this total the Chechens numbered 4,248 (238 officers, 724 sergeants, 3,286 privates). 12

    All in all, many of these and other reports are true. But they are true not only of the northern Caucasus. According to the NKVD department dealing with the struggle against banditry, 7,163 insurgent groups numbering 54,130 persons were smashed during the first three years of the war. 15 The breakdown for the northern Caucasus is: Dagestan—148 groups (3,380 persons); Kabardino-Balkaria—50 groups (3,241 persons); northern Ossetia—39 groups (323 persons); Krasnodarsk region—303 groups (2,985 persons); Stavro-polsk region—88 groups (3,316 persons). 16 Terror remains terror. To try to justify it is immoral. Absolutely immoral, too, were the actions of the authorities when, as punishment, they forcibly drove whole peoples, including veterans and heroes of World War II, from their native homes. The deportations were accompanied by mass abuse on the part of NKVD agents and troop units.

    The population of the republic at the end of 1961 stood at 892,400, including 432,000 Chechens and Ingush. Of the 418,000 Chechens and 106,000 Ingush who had been living in the Kazakh and Kirgiz republics, those who left for the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic totaled 468,000 (384,000 Chechens and 84,000 Ingush). All in all, 432,000 (356,000 Chechens and 76,000 Ingush) moved into Checheno-Ingushetia and 28,000 into the Dagestan ASSR. Some 56,000 (34,000 Chechens and 22,000 Ingush) remained in the Kazakh and Kirgiz republics. A new stage in the rehabilitation of the maltreated peoples began on 14 November 1989 with a declaration by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, “On the Recognition as Illegal and Criminal Repressive Acts against Peoples Subjected to Forced Resettlement and on the Guarantee of These Peoples’ Rights,” in which, for the first time, the illegality of the deportations was acknowledged and the practice of forced resettlement condemned.

    The main reason I have dwelt in detail on the fate of the Chechen people is that the knot tied by the Bolshevik regime is one we have not been able to undo to this day. Moreover, this knot is becoming tighter and tighter, especially after the criminal war in Chechnya. Personally, I do not see any real sense in separatism, as it serves the interests only of a narrow ruling elite. Singling out this or that people for sovereignty as a separate state is justifiable, in my view, if no less than 75 percent of the population vote for it. At the same time, the criminal actions of the Stalin regime could not fail to engender a deep-seated hatred of the imperial power. Russia will have to go on paying for a long time for the infamous policy of Stalinism toward the country’s nationalities.

    FROM horizon to horizon Russia is sown with crosses and with the nameless graves of its citizens, felled in wars, killed by famine, or shot at the whim of the Leninist-Stalinist fascist regime. The crosses mark the last remains of millions, and more millions lie in unmarked graves. They lie in ditches and trenches, in swamps, in mountain clefts, and some are just skeletons scattered in the forests of the Russian land.

    My own many years of experience in the rehabilitation of victims of political terror allow me to assert that the number of people in the USSR who were killed for political motives or who died in prisons and camps during the entire period of Soviet power totaled 20 to 25 million. And unquestionably one must add those who died of famine—more than 5.5 million during the civil war and more than 5 million during the 1930s. Documents that have already been published give some idea of the scope of the punitive policy. In the Russian Federation alone, according to incomplete data, the number of people sentenced between 1923 and 1953 totaled more than 41 million.

    The advent of Bolshevism in Russia was predicted by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who wrote in The Possessed that “one hundred million people will perish.” What did Bolshevism give to the world, to its peoples, to the individual? To the world: revolts, destruction, violent revolutions, civil wars, violence toward the individual. To its peoples: poverty, destitution, lawlessness, slavery both material and spiritual. To humankind: endless suffering. The Bolshevik state deprived the individual of freedom, honor, morality, prosperity, even faith in God. Bolshevism is a many-faced demonic frenzy, a militant antihuman grotesquerie. Its ideological models were Marxism of German origin and its English counterpart. But Bolshevism’s first real victory was won in Russia. As we know, the land of Rus accepted Christianity from Constantinople in 988 a.d. Characteristics of Byzantine rule of that era—baseness, cowardliness, venality, treachery, overcentralization, apotheosis of the ruler’s personality—dominate in Russia’s social and political life to this day. In the twelfth century the various fragmented Russian principalities from the Volga to the Carpathians were conquered by the Mongols. Asian traditions and customs, with their disregard for the individual and for human rights and their cult of might, violence, despotic power, and lawlessness became part of the Russian people’s way of life. The tragedy of Russia lay first and foremost in this: that for a thousand years it was ruled by men and not by laws. The rulers were princes, czars, various chairmen, general secretaries. They ruled ineptly, bloodily. The people existed for the government, not the government for the people. Russia avoided classical slavery. But it has not yet emerged from feudalism; it is still enslaved by an official imperial ideology, the essence of which is that the state is everything and the individual nothing. Russia found itself on the margins of civilization, inasmuch as it never knew the institution of normal private property. Property always belonged to the state, to its feudal elite—and today to the nomenklatura oligarchy of former apparatchiks. The lack of private property, especially land, is the primary reason for Russia’s woes, for its cruel fate.

    The beginning of the twentieth century is the brightest period in Russian history. Industrial development leaped forward at a rate that was equaled only later by Japan in the 1950s; finances stabilized, agricultural productivity rose. Parliamentarism was born. Compulsory primary education was instituted; universities, centers of higher education, traditional and modern secondary schools were opened. Science, art, and literature flourished. But in 1914 the First World War broke out. Early in the spring of 1917 the czar abdicated and a republic was proclaimed. It lasted only nine months: the Bolsheviks drowned it in blood, staging a counterrevolution. Three generations of Russians suffered through economic slavery and unimaginable terror, both physical and psychological, through World War II, Stalinism, the dictatorship of the Communist Party and its leaders.

    Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the counterrevolution, for the violent coup d’etat of 1917. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the establishment of a dictatorship instilled with hatred for the individual. As a result of its criminal actions, more than sixty million people were exterminated. Bolshevism, as a species and forerunner of fascism, made itself the principal force in the genocide of its own people. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for unleashing the fratricidal civil war that devastated the country; in the course of its senseless and bloody battles and destruction more than thirteen million people were killed, died of hunger, or emigrated. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the destruction of the Russian peasantry. Peasant Russia was demolished, its morality, traditions, and customs trampled. The productive capacity of the village was undermined so badly that for many years now, in order to avert famine, the country has been buying food from abroad. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the destruction of Christian churches and monasteries, Moslem mosques, Jewish synagogues, and other houses of worship, for the mass execution of clergy, for the persecution of believers, actions that have brought the country eternal disgrace. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the destruction of entire strata of Russian society—the officer caste, the nobility, the merchant class, the true intelligentsia, the community of scholars, scientists, and artists. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for violations of elementary rights, for falsifications, spurious accusations, and extrajudicial sentencings on a scale unheard of in all history; for executions without investigation or trial; for torture and torment; for organizing the system of concentration camps, including camps for children held hostage; for the use of poison gas against peaceful civilians—for the meat grinder of Leninist-Stalinist repressions in which more than twenty million people perished. Bolshevism cannot escape its responsibility for abolishing freedom of speech, for eliminating all democratic parties and movements, including those with a socialist orientation. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for its inept waging of the war against Hitler’s fascism. Only the sacrifice of thirty million of our citizens and the heroism of the people saved the country from subjugation. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for its crimes against former Soviet prisoners of war and repatriates, for driving them after the war into Soviet camps and exploiting their hard labor with the aim of working them to death. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for waging genocide against non-Russian citizens of the USSR, for forcibly resettling in the country’s most sparsely populated regions Germans, Poles, Tatars, Chechens, Ingush, Karachayevs, Koreans, Balkars, Kalmyks, Turko-Meskhetins, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks, and Gagauzy. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for organizing the hounding of scholars and writers, of those active in film, theater, and music, of doctors and others; for the colossal damage done to the nation’s culture and science. Out of criminal ideological motives, genetics and cybernetics, as well as progressive movements in economics, linguistics, and literary and artistic endeavor, were ostracized. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for organizing racist trials—against the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, against the “doctors-murderers”—aimed at fomenting enmity among the country’s national groups and playing on the masses’ vilest instincts. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for organizing criminal campaigns against every kind of dissidence, whose many adherents were subjected to the widest array of punishments—prison, exile, special resettlement, expulsion abroad, psychiatric institutionalization, loss of jobs, slanderous attacks in the press, and other indignities. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the total militarization of the country, which rendered the people destitute and drastically stunted the development of society. Bolshevism cannot escape responsibility for the antigovernment mutiny of August 1991, which led to the disorderly breakup of the state and to unimaginable hardship for all the peoples of the former Soviet Union. How short our memory is, even today. We crawl pitifully along, bogged down in the mire. The main source of our troubles has yet to dawn on us: without the de-Bolshevization of Russia there can be no question of the nation’s recovery, its renascence and its resumption of its place in world civilization. Only when it has shaken free of Bolshevism can Russia hope to be healed.
