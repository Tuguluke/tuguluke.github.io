    That old Constitution is coming out of exile. What we are seeing is, in important respects, in the nature of a regime change, or a paradigm shift. Any snapshot will rapidly go out of date, but consider the following: • The right to choose abortion has been eliminated; • The right to privacy, as such, is in deep trouble; • The individual right to possess guns, first recognized in 2008, is being expanded; • The rights of religious believers are rapidly growing; • Affirmative action is on its heels, and it might well be eliminated; • Commercial advertising is being protected more than ever before; • Expenditures on political campaigns are being treated like political speech; • People’s rights to sue the government are being radically curtailed; • Property rights are expanding; and • The administrative state, and its efforts with respect to safety, health, and the environment, are under severe constitutional pressure (in some ways, this may be the most important development of all).

    True, the Constitution itself does not change over time (unless amended), but the meanings of its terms do change over time, not only because of changes in facts but also because of changes in values.

    At the same time, I believe that constitutional interpretation should be undertaken with close reference to the underlying goal of creating a deliberative democracy—a system that places a premium on reason-giving in the public domain (and hence on a deliberative democracy) and also on accountability to We the People (and hence on a deliberative democracy).

    1. Theories of Interpretation
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 22 · Location 382
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Many people claim to be “textualists”; they insist on adhering to the text of the Constitution. They think that the text is binding, and they think it important as well as self-evident that judges must be faithful to it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    Second Amendment says this: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Does that mean that individuals have a right to carry guns in public, or not?
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 23 · Location 398

<div class="noteText">
    The First Amendment says that “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.” It does not apply to the president, the Department of Justice, or the Department of Homeland Security. The Court reads the First Amendment as if it says, “The U.S. government shall not abridge the freedom of speech.” Is that a mistake? (Short answer: No.) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment says this: “nor shall [any person] be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Does that text forbid racial segregation? As a matter of text, the answer is almost certainly no. The Court reads the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as if it says, “The federal government may not discriminate on the basis of race.” Is that a mistake? (Same short answer.)

    Larry Alexander of the University of San Diego Law School writes that “given what we accept as legally authoritative, the proper way to interpret the Constitution … is to seek its authors’ intended meanings—the same thing we do when we read a letter from Mom, a shopping list from our spouse, or instructions for how to assemble a child’s toy made in China.”

    They insist instead that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way that fits with its original public meaning. In their view, the original public meaning is objective, not subjective, and it does indeed make most constitutional questions easy. Original public meaning originalism is now ascendant; it is the preferred current form of originalism. Justice Antonin Scalia defended it. Justice Clarence Thomas subscribes to it, and so does Justice Neil Gorsuch. Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Samuel Alito Jr., and Brett Kavanaugh are keenly interested in it. The original public meaning includes not only semantic meaning, but also the shared public context, 6 which offers various forms of “contextual enrichment.”

    James Madison appeared to reject originalism in all its forms and to seek a more flexible approach to constitutional interpretation. As Jonathan Gienapp puts it, young Madison “had assumed the Constitution was incomplete, partial, and in critical ways indeterminate.” 10 He believed “that ongoing discussion and experiences would help make new meanings that would flesh out the unfinished edifice that he had helped construct.”

<div class="noteText">
    It is also more than interesting that in his later years, alert to the flexibility of semantic originalism and the risk of instability over time, Madison vigorously endorsed public meaning originalism. He did so in a plain effort to stabilize constitutional meaning. 12 The “meaning of a Constitution,” Madison wrote, had to be “fixed and known” to ensure against “that instability which is incompatible with good government.”

    In line with the suggestion in Brown, racial segregation in public schools might not violate the Constitution at a time when public education did not play a significant role in American life, but it might violate the Constitution when public education is central to American life. For public meaning originalism, this is a complicated argument, but it is at least intelligible.

    Some people think that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the ratifiers’ views about how it should be interpreted. 18 On that view, judges need to follow the ratifiers’ theory of interpretation.

    The public might have expected, for example, that the First Amendment would not protect blasphemy, but the original public meaning of the First Amendment might be consistent with protection of blasphemy.

    Ely’s view can easily be seen as an elaboration of the most famous footnote in all of American constitutional law—footnote 4 in the Carolene Products case. 22 In that case, the Court emphasized its limited role in American government and said that it would be exceedingly reluctant to strike down state and federal legislation. At the same time, as a kind of qualification, footnote 4 said, in relevant part: It is unnecessary to consider now whether legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legislation [referring to “restrictions upon the right to vote”; “restraints upon the dissemination of information”; “interferences with political organizations”; and “prohibition of peaceable assembly”].

    In Ely’s view, the Constitution should be interpreted in a way that makes the democratic process work as well as possible, and that makes up for deficits in it. Above all, Ely urged that courts should vigorously protect the preconditions for self-government.

    He had no trouble with affirmative action! On that issue, he believed, the democratic process can be trusted, because white Americans are not at a systematic disadvantage.

    Many people, including many judges, are traditionalists; they think that constitutional interpretation should be undertaken with close reference to long-standing traditions. They are keen admirers of Edmund Burke, who deplored abstract theorizing about liberty and equality, and who argued in favor of careful attention to the beliefs and work of generations.

<div class="noteText">
    Traditionalists do not like it when judges speak of evolving values or new understandings of liberty or equality. They cherish the wisdom of the past, not new thinking (about, say, same-sex marriage or the rights of criminal defendants).
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 46 · Location 734
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Consider this passage from the Supreme Court in its decision requiring states to recognize same-sex marriage: 33 The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.

    More specifically, Thayer urged that in the face of a constitutional challenge, all reasonable doubts should be resolved favorably to Congress, in the sense that the Constitution should be interpreted in a way that gives the political process maximum room to maneuver.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 49 · Location 770

<div class="noteText">
    The remarkable practice of judicial review, as Thayer called it, was a product not of logic but of experience, and in particular a product of our political experience before the Revolutionary War. 40 (Remember Concord?) Great Britain had an external sovereign; the United States did not. In the United States, We the People are sovereign.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 51 · Location 798

    The reason is that in these cases, and countless others, the constitutional question is at least “open to rational question,” which means that courts must not strike

<div class="noteText">
    If we are originalists, of course, we might refuse to be Thayerians; we will follow the original meaning (and be Thayerians only when the original meaning, or something in the public understanding at the time of ratification, directs us to be). If we are traditionalists, we might refuse to be Thayerians; everything might depend on the content of the traditions, and on how clear they are. Those who believe in democracy reinforcement will be inclined to reject Thayerism when democracy is at risk but will uphold legislation much of the time.

<div class="noteText">
    For those who embrace left-of-center Thayerism, or the abolition of judicial review, the most revealing judicial decisions are those • striking down maximum hour and minimum wage laws; • protecting the right to possess guns; • banning affirmative action programs; • striking down campaign finance regulation; • protecting commercial advertising; • jeopardizing the Affordable Care Act; and • forbidding regulation designed to protect safety, health, and the environment.

    In England and the United States, common-law courts develop principles of contract law, property law, and tort law not by reference to some authoritative text, but on a case-by-case basis.

<div class="noteText">
    Those who celebrate common-law constitutionalism do not dispute this point. Instead they argue that the process of case-by-case reasoning, focused on details and respectful of precedent, has large advantages over more top-down approaches, invoking abstract theories about (for example) liberty or equality, or the broad power of the president.

<div class="noteText">
    My central claim in this chapter is that in the context of constitutional law, there is nothing that interpretation “just is.” Among the reasonable alternatives, no approach to constitutional interpretation is required or self-justifying. Any approach must be defended on some ground—not asserted as part of what interpretation requires by its nature.

    Recall original intentions originalism: In interpreting the meaning of words, we ask about authorial intentions. (I use the term “author” to include speakers as well as writers.) Some people think that is what it means to interpret words; they believe that theirs is the only reasonable way to interpret any text, including the Constitution. It is a preposterous claim;

<div class="noteText">
    We have seen that the most committed contemporary originalists, led by Justice Scalia and now including Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, believe that what matters is the original public meaning of the document, not intentions at all.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 66 · Location 1119
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    We have seen that those who focus on original public meaning, now very much in the ascendancy, argue that meaning is objective, not subjective. In their view, what matters is the standard understanding among the Constitution’s ratifiers, not what the authors intended. After all, the ratifiers (“ We the People”), and not the authors, turned the Constitution into law. Rejecting subjective intentions, Justice Holmes wrote, “We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statutes mean.”

    For example, Justice Scalia makes both kinds of arguments. His own defense of originalism, as a “lesser evil,” focuses a great deal on what would make the American constitutional order (or any constitutional order) better rather than worse. Justice Scalia is much concerned about the risks associated with judicial discretion; he thinks that nonoriginalist approaches, and any form of “living constitutionalism,” will effectively license judges to do whatever they want. In a democracy, how can that be a good thing? Justice Scalia contends that if judges adhere to original meaning, the relevant risks will be diminished, because judges will be constrained. 9 Those are fair points; any approach to constitutional interpretation must contend with them.

    Justice Clarence Thomas favors the original public meaning, and he would give it priority over the decided cases. Justice Antonin Scalia also liked the original public meaning, but on important occasions he would defer to the precedents, even if they violated the original understanding.

<div class="noteText">
    My main claim in this chapter, and indeed in this book, is that in order to choose a theory of constitutional interpretation, judges (and others) must seek “reflective equilibrium,” in which their judgments, at multiple levels of generality, are brought into alignment with one another. 1 Indeed, I will be suggesting that there is no other way to choose a theory of constitutional interpretation. It follows that judges (and others) must consider the consequences of their choice for particular judgments that operate, for them, as provisional “fixed points,” understood as judgments that seem both clear and firm.

When we produce “principles which match our considered judgments duly pruned and adjusted,” we are in “reflective equilibrium,” defined as such because “our principles and judgments coincide,” and because “we know to what principles our judgments conform and the premises of their derivation.”

    With wide reflective equilibrium, we think more broadly. We expose our beliefs to a range of abstract moral theories: deontology, utilitarianism, Aristotelian approaches. Rawls’s own interest was in wide reflective equilibrium. In Norman Daniels’s influential account, wide reflective equilibrium is “a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories.” 24

    You might be drawn to utilitarianism; does that mean that you would strangle a child, if that is the only way to save a village? Utilitarianism might be inconsistent with judgments about particular cases that operate as provisional fixed points, and it might ultimately be rejected for that reason. 25 You might be drawn to Kantianism and insist that people should be treated with respect, and as ends rather than means, whatever the consequences; does that mean that you would not lie, even when that it is the only way to divert a terrorist? Kantianism might also be inconsistent with judgments about particular cases that operate as provisional fixed points, and it might be revised or rejected for that reason.

    In making that argument in 1954, the Supreme Court invoked the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids the federal government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property “without due process of law.” But when it was ratified in 1791, did the Due Process Clause forbid racial segregation? Certainly not. In any case, the Due Process Clause seems to guarantee process (of some kind); it does not appear to forbid discrimination at all.

    Return in this light to the idea, associated with James Bradley Thayer, that the Court should uphold legislation unless it is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional. Thayer embraced the view that “an Act of the legislature is not to be declared void unless the violation of the constitution is so manifest as to leave no room for reasonable doubt.”

    For its part, equal protection traditionalism does not seem at all promising, in part because it would be inconsistent with so many fixed points. 37 Actually, equal protection traditionalism seems terrible. The Equal Protection Clause is a challenge to existing traditions, not an effort to protect them. Discrimination on the basis of sex is not exactly inconsistent with long-standing traditions.

    In an oral argument in 2022, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson offered an originalist argument in favor of affirmative action: 42 So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that “unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen.” That’s not—that’s not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy.… I don’t think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right? … And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn’t have a constitutional foundation, that’s when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play. It was drafted to give a foundational—a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens.

    Of the various responses, the most complicated is the fifth, to the effect that originalism is mandatory and so the only truly fixed point. To evaluate that claim, we need to specify the right conception of originalism; which kind is mandatory? In chapter 2 we saw that whatever kind of originalism we specify, it is a choice, and it has to be defended on some ground. We might choose to interpret the words of the Constitution in accordance with the “original intentions” of the ratifiers; that is an admissible understanding of interpretation.

    In the abstract, many people are drawn to Thayerism, on the ground that it is highly respectful of the democratic process. In our world, however, it would be intolerable; it would lead to an unduly truncated system of rights and liberties. In the abstract, many people are drawn to traditionalism. The question is whether it would tear at the fabric of too much of American constitutional law (see chapter 5). In the abstract, many people are drawn to originalism. The question is what it would produce or entail. In my view, democracy-reinforcing judicial review is a terrific foundation for modern constitutional law.

    The current Supreme Court is often an originalist court, but much of the time it is a traditionalist court. As we have seen, the two are close, but they are not the same. We might note at the outset that originalism and traditionalism share something in common: They hope to limit judicial discretion, and they seek to ensure that judges will speak for the values and commitments of others, not themselves. They hope to reduce the risk of judicial tyranny, whatever its form. They are also backward-looking, which is part of their appeal.

    In 1955, William F. Buckley Jr., the influential conservative thinker, wrote of his then-new magazine, National Review: “It stands athwart history, yelling Stop.” Traditionalists do exactly that. They do so on principle. They believe that traditions are likely to be good, because they reflect the wisdom of numerous people over time and are the opposite of a short-term fad; recall Burke’s arguments on behalf of that conclusion. They also believe that efforts to assess traditions are likely to go wrong; recall Burke’s emphasis on the limits of the reason of individuals or even of individual generations.

    In Dobbs, the Court said that while the Due Process Clause “has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution,” its reach is limited to rights that are (1) “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and (2) “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” The Court emphasized that the very idea of “substantive due process,” by which the Due Process Clause extends beyond procedural guarantees, “has long been controversial.” By itself, the text of the Clause seems to suggest a purely procedural interpretation; it reads as if it is focused on processes, not on whether laws are reasonable. It seems to require fair hearings (“ due process”). It does not appear, on its face, to give any substantive protection to rights at all. 5 It seems to suggest that people must receive notice before their liberty is taken, without saying that government is flatly prohibited from imposing burdens or restricting freedom. John Hart Ely went so far as to describe substantive due process as “a contradiction in terms—sort of like ‘green pastel redness.’

    Regrettably, we need one more ism: Dworkinism.

    This statement by the Dobbs Court is true: “[ T] he Constitution makes no mention of abortion.” 33 It is also true that the Constitution makes no mention of the following: • education • segregation • sterilization • blasphemy • libel • false statements of fact • incitement • sedition • obscenity • commercial advertising • expenditures on political campaigns • school prayer • one person, one vote • the right to vote34 • sex discrimination35 • affirmative action • injury in fact • regulations that diminish the value of property This is a list of just a few of the things that the Constitution does not mention that have been taken to give rise to serious constitutional challenges, and in many cases to invalidation of state or federal legislation. Should we say that because the Constitution does not mention education, Brown v. Board of Education was wrong? In the 1950s, many critics of Brown said exactly that. Shall we say that because the Constitution does not mention defamation or libel, New York Times v. Sullivan was wrong? Shall we say that because the Constitution does not mention affirmative action, the Court has been wrong to strike down affirmative action programs? These are preposterous questions. The Constitution speaks of “freedom of speech”; it does not speak of criticism of the president, or libel, or blasphemy, or use of vulgar language. The Constitution speaks of “the equal protection of the laws”; it does not speak of juries, police, fire, or education. We need to know what the general language means. What Dobbs is saying is that at least when we are dealing with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, courts should cabin their analysis by asking about the content of tradition. That suggestion raises a fundamental question: How are we to assess rulings that protect the right to sexual privacy and to same-sex marriage—rights that are emphatically nontraditionalist (and also non-Thayerian)? Should we be constitutional traditionalists in general? Free speech traditionalists in particular? Property rights traditionalists? Equal protection traditionalists?

    Consider the following propositions: 1. The Constitution does not forbid maximum hour and minimum wage laws. 2. Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided; the Constitution does not permit racial segregation. 3. The Supreme Court has been right to strike down laws that discriminate on the basis of sex. 4. The First Amendment should be understood to give very broad protection to political speech, subject to the qualification in (5). 5. The Supreme Court should be much less aggressive in reviewing restrictions on campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. 6. The Supreme Court should be much less aggressive than it has been in reviewing restrictions on commercial advertising. 7. The Supreme Court was wrong to hold that “political gerrymandering” presents a political question, not subject to judicial review. 8. The Constitution allows Congress to grant broad discretion to administrative agencies. 9. Griswold v. Connecticut, protecting the right of married couples to use contraceptives, was correctly decided. 10. The Supreme Court should continue to allow the existence of independent agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. In my view, all of these propositions are correct. Indeed, they are clearly correct. Out of the closet we come: These are my fixed points; they are part of my reflective equilibrium, such as it is.

    As we live it, constitutional law is not a matter of deduction. It is rooted in a common-law process, one of case-by-case decision making, in which identifiable moral aspirations and commitments play a central role, and in which defining constitutional rulings are animated by an insistence on deliberative democracy and the anticaste principle. We could do a lot worse; we cannot do a lot better.

    Recall these words from James Jackson, a representative from Georgia, in 1789: “Our Constitution is like a vessel just launched, and lying at the wharf, she is untried, and you can hardly discover any one of her properties.” 7 About 150 years after Jackson spoke, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said that “we revere” the founding document “not because it is old but because it is ever new, not in the worship of its past alone but in the faith of the living who keep it young, now and in the years to come.” The vessel is no longer lying at the wharf. She is tried. You can discover her properties. They are a product of the faith of the living who keep her young.
