    As theorists of contemporary capitalism (Berardi 2015; R. Benjamin 2019; Wark 2019; Zuboff 2019) have shown, between 2010 and 2020 smartphones have become tracking devices that claim life experience and behavior as surplus data that can be turned into prediction products which shape social life. Terror Capitalism places that body of theory, what Shoshana Zuboff (2019) calls “surveillance capitalism,” in conversation with recent feminist and decolonial examinations of the global co-construction of contemporary capitalism and colonialism (Coulthard 2014; Bear et al. 2015; Byrd et al. 2018; Rofel and Yanagisako 2018). In doing so, it explores how a state-funded, privately built surveillance system produced Ablikim and millions of other Muslims in Northwest China as objects of terror capitalism.

    It considers the rise of state-directed private technology development in China to make a broader argument about a global turn toward techno-political systems of capitalist accumulation more generally. Specifically, it considers the roles that digital media surveillance play in political control and economic growth. This system resonates with processes of political regime change, as in other counterterrorism campaigns, but in this case it is attempting to produce an epistemic transformation through surveillance and unfree labor. Knowledge production, and the social life it supports, is the ultimate object of this contemporary capitalist and colonial project.

    racial capitalism and settler colonialism have been co-created through state-enabled forms of dispossession (Coulthard 2014; Pasternak 2015; Day 2016). Racial capitalism and settler colonialism are distinctive frontiers of expropriative capital accumulation; the former focuses on enslaved or dependent labor of ethno-racialized others, while the latter centers on enclosure, and the dispossession of land and institutions of ethno-racialized others.

    By eating into Uyghur social reproduction through comprehensive surveillance systems, mass detention, and family separation, Uyghur women and men are pushed toward a lumpen form of proletarianization that centers on a reified form of Han cultural values defined as “Chinese.”

    A major difference in the Black American and Uyghur experiences of mass incarceration is that Uyghurs are being made the target of economistic transformation as unfree workers behind checkpoints, under cameras and satellites while simultaneously being targeted with epistemic retraining. In the United States, the enormous numbers of Black Americans incarcerated since the civil rights movement is a way for lawmakers and invested citizens to maintain racial hierarchy and racial dispossession (Gilmore 2007). This was the motivating interest that led to the current profit-making American prison industry. In China there is a derivation of this process. There, the detention system is a means rather than an end in itself of transforming an ethnic other into an unfree but economically productive workforce. It is also important to note that, in the American context, systems of deeply flawed due process, representative democracy, a free press, and civil protest allow for the formal contestation of institutionalized racism. In the context of Northwest China, authoritarian governance prevents formal decolonial and antiracist movements. As a result, Uyghurs are overtly produced by state authorities and in everyday settler discourse as subhuman under the sign of terror. They must be saved from themselves, much like Native “savage” populations in European and North American settler colonialism.

    Because China was partially colonized in the past, this rhetoric suggests, it is impossible for China to colonize others in the future. Instead, in a manner similar to Japanese justifications for their colonization of parts of China and Taiwan, the colonization of Uyghurs is presented as an act of rescue.

    Since Han citizens themselves have been the subject of European and American racism, many scholars are reluctant to describe the process of Uyghur dispossession as a product of ethno-racialization.

    The overall goal of a settler nation is access to land and resources and the elimination of all obstacles that stand in its way. In Northwest China, the fact of Uyghur existence was thus one of the primary obstacles to this project. This challenge produced multiple outcomes. On the one hand, the state strove to capture the religious and cultural institutions of Uyghur society while, on the other, it sought to create a new market-oriented society on yerlik lands.

    Emily Yeh (2012) notes that, in the Chinese application of a capacious post-9/ 11 counterterrorism, “any perceived threat to state territorial sovereignty, regardless of its actual methods or effects vis-à-vis harm to others,” can be deemed terrorism. Importantly, this threat can only be produced by minoritized bodies, particularly Muslim male bodies, since mass murder carried out by Han civilians is not seen as a threat to Chinese self-determination.

    In both cases, Uyghur women often became an abstract object “to be saved.” Perhaps more significantly, the institutionalization of power over the bodies of Uyghurs defined Uyghur masculinity and femininity through an expansive process of racialization. In the minds of state authorities and Han settlers who were moving into Uyghur-majority areas, the perceived wild virulence of Uyghur masculinity was imagined as a constant, if often abstract, threat to state and settler claims to land possession (Tynen 2020; see also Moreton-Robinson 2015).

    Real estate speculation, natural resources, and international trade associated with the development project permitted many Han settlers to find better standards of living for themselves. They also saw state institutions aligning with and protecting their interests even as development increased indebtedness among Uyghurs, who were systematically blocked from low-interest lines of credit by nationalized banks that placed restrictions on loans to Uyghurs due to their assumed disposition toward terrorism.

    As a result, minoritized peoples frequently found themselves caught in a downward spiral of poverty even as the Han society that was growing around them was increasingly affluent. In another iteration of the “disempowered development” that Andrew Fischer has found in Tibet (2013), they were simultaneously excluded from entering the capitalist system as members of the proletariat, or civil rights–bearing classes, exploited as disposable service workers, and blamed for not finding their way in the new economy.

    The bodies of Uyghurs—the way they dress, their intimate relations, personal hygiene, their accent, their diet, facial expressions, physical and virtual behavior, and language use—are the primary object of human face-to-face ethnic profiling and the pseudoscientific presentation of techno-political surveillance. In the context of the Chinese frontier, their ethnic and Native difference has come to act as a kind of racialized difference: an institutionalized system of domination and exclusion.

    She argues that private capital differs from Chinese state capital in that the former is largely driven by shareholder demands, while the latter—acting in more of a Fordist model of economic development—moves at a longer temporal scale and is less dependent on immediate profits, thus affording those who are employed by it more stability. This state-capital driven usage of infrastructure development as a way of off-loading and building further capacities in particular regional localities across China is central to what some scholars refer to as a Chinese “Model of Development” (Oakes 2019). Lee (2018) shows that, in the context of global China, state capital deployment is driven less by profitization than by Chinese domestic market saturation, or overcapacity, and long-term strategic interests in resources and standards setting (which, perhaps, are less operative in the transnational textile industry).

    In fact, drawing on Robinson, Robin D. G. Kelley (2017, quoted in Goldstein 2017) notes: “Race and gender are not incidental or accidental features of the global capitalist order, they are constitutive. Capitalism emerged as a racial and gendered regime.… The secret to capitalism’s survival is racism, and the racial and patriarchal state. Capitalism developed and operates within a racial system or racial regime. Racism is fundamental for the production and reproduction of capitalism, and that violence is necessary for creating and maintaining capitalism.”

    For example, on March 8, 2018, in a celebration of International Women’s Day, Uyghur men in towns across the Uyghur homeland were asked to wash the feet of their wives as a way of demonstrating their submission to the state’s definition of feminist gender relationships in their domestic life. This sign of gender equality was of course heavily freighted with Han cultural symbolism and in fact antithetical to Uyghur practices of Islamic purity. In Uyghur cultural performance, it is considered deeply unclean to wash one’s feet, or the feet of another, in a bowl rather than pouring water from a vessel. It is also a violation of the purity of Islamic ablutions in which the hands and feet are washed prior to prayer, something that state authorities were explicitly attempting to violate. Uyghurs, both men and women, experienced this activity as deeply degrading and shameful.

    Land enclosure is central to the history of capitalism because it marks a shift to expropriation of land and labor from marginalized, often Indigenous or ethno-racialized, populations, through the imposition of a new contract-based legal regime of property possession and wage labor. In a classical Marxist account, this is described as an enforced separation of laborers from their land and autonomous subsistence and thus a removal from the “means of production”

    In fact, though differently expressed in various historical moments and situations, colonialism is always a feature of the capitalist social order (Coulthard 2014; Byrd et al. 2018). This means that minoritized people, their way of life, and their ancestral lands are continually and more fully enclosed in service to resource extraction and new labor regimes (Robinson 1983).

    Indeed, land-based traditions, Islamic faith, and modernist Turkic identity formed the basis of the independent East Turkestan republics that predated the founding of the People’s Republic of China and the decades of settler colonization that followed (Thum 2014; Brophy 2016). These three elements, combined with a deep-seated attachment to the built environment of Uyghur civilization—courtyard houses, mosque communities, and Sufi shrines—produced knowledge systems that resulted in Uyghur forms of distinction and difference from the Han population that had arrived in waves since 1949.

    The way this incident of perceived sexual harassment was able to escalate so quickly remains a mystery. Perhaps the Han migrant workers felt disadvantaged due to the government aid the Uyghur workers had received in getting jobs at the factory. Perhaps there were other racially charged incidents that led up to this violence. As Huang Cuilian, the “Han girl” whose alleged harassment triggered the violence put it, “I was lost and entered the wrong dormitory and screamed when I saw those Uyghur young men in the room.… I just felt they were unfriendly so I turned and ran.” 5 She then recalled how one of them stood up and stamped his feet as if to chase her, “I later realized that he was just making fun of me.”

    In response to these concerns, state authorities mandated a counterterrorism project that offered many private companies a novel space to rapidly prototype predictive policing tools and experiment with biometric surveillance systems. For instance, the AI Champion iFLYTEK developed tools to automate the transcription and translation of Uyghur-language audio into Chinese where it could then be analyzed for precriminal and criminal content (Li and Cadell 2018). The computer-vision analytics company Sensetime worked on a joint venture with a subsidiary called Sensenets to track the movements and behaviors of over 2.5 million inhabitants of the Uyghur region using face surveillance technologies (Cimpanau 2018). A rival computer-vision company, Megvii, developed tools to support surveillance-video analytics (“ Niaokan” 2017), while another computer-vision company Yitu, using a project called Dragonfly Eye, drew on a dataset of over 1.5 billion faces to automate the detection of Uyghur faces. 6 Another AI Champion HikVision, a market-oriented subsidiary of the SOE military supplier China Electronics Technology Company, received nearly $ 300 million in Private Public Partnership contracts to develop “Safe City” surveillance systems with “zero blank spaces” throughout Uyghur-majority areas, from mosques to the interiors of reeducation camps (Rollet 2018).

In 2016 and 2017, the state invested an estimated $ 7.2 billion specifically in the Xinjiang information security industry as part of an increase of public security spending of over 90 percent. 8 Over those same years the state awarded an estimated $ 65 billion in private contracts to build infrastructure and $ 160 billion more to government entities in the region—an increase of nearly 50 percent.

The People’s War on Terror became a euphemism for Han inclusion as “the people” conducting “the war” and Uyghur exclusion as the objects of terror. The war, combined with processes of Uyghur enclosure and dispossession, produced a powerful “state effect” (T. Mitchell 1999; Yeh 2013) in which state power was ceded to Han settlers and implemented through the private and public institutions that supported them. Through a process of reevaluation, the work of low-income Han migrants accrued value on behalf of the nation while Uyghur migrants were evaluated as precriminals.

Unlike in cities in Eastern China, recent rural-to-urban Han migrants enjoyed a sense of prestige and distinction relative to the Native inhabitants of the city they had come to occupy. As Zang Xiaowei (2011, 155) notes, Han nonstate workers in Ürümchi earned on average 52 percent more than Uyghurs in the city. Across the region as a whole, inequality in income was at around 28 percent (Liu and Peters 2017, 270).

Because Uyghurs lack space to produce and stage representations of the types of distinction they desire, negative stereotypes of Uyghurs as backward and potentially dangerous have pervaded Chinese popular culture. To a greater extent than Han migrants in the city, particularly after the People’s War on Terror began, Uyghur migrants were prevented from pursuing their desires through the cultivation and performance of the self. 9 Instead, Uyghur desires were often perceived by state authorities, corporate workers, and Han migrants as too Uyghur and too Islamic and not Chinese enough.

    The term Indigenous is a contested term in China (Elliott 2015). There are several interrelated reasons for this. The most general reason for this contestation is its rejection by state authorities as a concept that threatens the sovereignty of the state in China and, by extension, the right of the majority to possess minority land and labor. If minoritized, land-based people—such as Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Tibetans, who speak different languages, have different faith practices, and in most cases, possess non-Han ethno-racial phenotypes—were permitted to identify themselves as Indigenous, it would be more difficult for Chinese authorities and Han settlers to justify their claims to their ancestral lands and control over their social reproduction. The second reason for this contestation comes from exiled communities, and some scholars, who view the term Indigenous as signifying a primitive “backwardness,” the antithesis of state modernity typified by claims to desired ethno-states of Tibet and East Turkestan.

At the same time, the way their flourishing was indexed to Uyghur dispossession was rarely recognized. Instead, Han migrants often saw their own hard work and their own investments in themselves as the cause of their success. If they did think about the diminishment of Uyghur social life, it was often seen as deserving of diminishment because Uyghurs were backward or dangerous. Uyghurs were often seen as not having achieved the quality necessary for life in the city.

This value is often expressed as confidence, distinction, and the production of further desire in the individual. It also reproduces hierarchies of power in ways that are unacknowledged. Often this value added to a life is not the result of personal striving. Sometimes improved social status comes to people simply because of the presentation of their body and the way that body is recognized by state and private institutions. Those impelled by an achieved quality economy to work hard may never be able to achieve what comes easily to a differently positioned person. Suzhi is mediated by linguistic regimes, popular culture, educational policy, national security, and interpersonal distinction to name only a few of its catalysts.

    the term dispossession refers to a Marxist critique of capitalist accumulation by dispossession. It is often used not to discuss “original accumulation” of natural resources and colonized bodies but the way marginalized people lose their property. As Glen Coulthard (2014) and Alyosha Goldstein (2017) and others have demonstrated, however, 3 in colonial contexts, dispossession is more than the uncompensated loss of quantifiable abstract property; it also refers to a relationship of domination that moves through discursive and nondiscursive facets of everyday life, from the material to the epistemic. Possession does not simply refer to property remaining under the control of its rightful owners; rather, in this context, it refers to a type of self-determination or autonomy that is rooted in Indigenous knowledge. The dispossession of a Native people’s way of life involves forcing them into a new social order, transforming their land into a commodity, their traditional labor into wage labor, their consumption into a new regime of value, and their thoughts into imposed ideological frameworks.

    Importantly, as feminist scholars of capitalist frontier making have noted, the ongoing dispossession of marginalized populations creates forms of expropriated or stolen labor and property that are often unmediated by civil rights or contract law. As Nancy Fraser (2016) argues, ongoing processes of ethno-racialization and sexism naturalize devalued, unfree, dependent labor that is excluded from “exploitive” yet “freely chosen” wage labor. 4 This results in colonized peoples and women being slotted into subordinated roles as sharecroppers, low-wage or unpaid service workers, or domestic servants. The perceived threat, “backwardness,” or impurity of linguistic, cultural, and sexual difference justify enclosure and processes of devaluation similar to those I examined in preceding chapters.

    The old man sighed at this point and said, “What those people who are buying and selling trees are forgetting is that the trees hold the spirits of our ancestors within them. We have always used wood to build the thresholds of our houses, but we did so out of respect for the trees and as a way of guarding our home from evil spirits. Now that respect is lost.” In essence, he was saying that, when people begin to treat sacred landscapes like natural sources of capital, they are dispossessed of their relationship with the deep history of the land.

    As the historian James Millward (2021) notes, although the economy has grown at exponential rates across China, Uyghur rural incomes have grown at declining rates and they have been pushed into tenant-farming positions. Building on the pioneering work of the Uyghur economist Ilham Tohti (2009, 2015), he shows that systematic blockage of Uyghurs from lines of credit, business credentialing, and the obstruction of free movement, while incentivizing Han settlement and capital accumulation, has built a racialization of ethnicity into the economic development of the region. This has resulted in what anthropolgists Ildikó Bellér-Hann and Chris Hann (2020) have termed “the great dispossession” of the Uyghurs—an overwhelming threshold movement within the broad sweep of the colonial history of the region (242).

    Based on my interviews with farmers and their relatives, within just a few short years, many Uyghur farmers were forced to sign debt-inducing contracts that did not meet their basic living expenses or their seed and farming equipment expenses. Farming itself was turned into a form of tenant farming in which farmers could not decide for themselves what they were to grow as centralized industrial farming took over their land.

    As the Uyghur scholar Bakhtiyar Tursun, a social scientist based at Xinjiang University, notes in a systematic study of farming economy in the Uyghur heartland of Khotan, Kashgar, and Aqsu, rural farmers were nearly always forced to pay a percentage of their profits to work brigades (Ch: dadui) who signed contracts with state and private buyers. As one local official in Khotan Prefecture described it to him, “If a farmer grows 10 acres of wheat, according to the local standards for harvest yield and grain sales price, the farmer should receive an income of 4,500–5,000 yuan. However, the farmland fee, planting fee, water fee, fertilization fee, management fee, land tax, township and village fund payment, public welfare payments and other expenditures will total around 4,000 yuan. After deducting these expenses, the farmer will only receive around 500–1,000 yuan” (B. Tursun 2003, 77). As a result, by the early 2000s, in many counties in the Uyghur homeland of Southern Xinjiang, the rights to a high percentage of arable land were owned by a few powerful individuals within local party institutions. For example, according to a number of farmers I interviewed, in a county near Turpan a single individual owned rights to an estimated 60 percent of all available farming land. In a county near Kashgar, a single family of local officials owned rights to nearly 80 percent of all arable land. 9 This meant, in effect, that the majority of Uyghurs in these counties were living as sharecroppers: their land and work were largely owned by local officials. 10 Many Uyghur farmers, or their children, were forced to look for work elsewhere either as migrant agricultural workers or as small-scale traders and hired hands in local towns or, at times, the big city of Ürümchi.

    this attitude led to an acceptance of one’s vulnerability and, in turn, a dependence on the will of God, one’s community, and the benevolence of local authorities. Memet noted that most Uyghur farmers placed little value in long-term planning and investment and instead took one day at a time. He argued that, traditionally, Uyghur farmers have not stressed self-reliance and thus spent what little money they had as soon as they received it. Memet is not arguing that Uyghur farmers are lazy—as is often the case in Chinese discussions of the work ethics of unassimilated minorities in China (Yeh 2007b). Instead, he is pointing out that, when Uyghur farmers are pulled into the market economy, they are forced to give up their reliance on the community and the benevolence of God, and instead claim a self-motivated subjectivity.

    In addition to its relationship to material possession, dispossession can also be thought of as a relationship of the mind to the self. As Judith Butler and Athena Athanasiou argue (2013), the idea of being fully in possession of one’s self as an individual is a particular capitalist modality. It centers around the perception of control or autonomy on the part of the individual subject. By increasing more and more control over one’s self through processes of self-discipline and self-responsibility, the capitalist subject assumes that the choices she or he makes are not enclosed by larger social forces or supported by processes of unpaid social reproduction; rather, they are acts of freedom. Possessing the self produces a disavowal or misapprehension of the community and infrastructures that enable a life to be lived. Although there is a great deal of variation across sectors of the global capitalist economy, ideas of self-possession have increasingly taken precedence over feelings of communal forms of belonging. This site of conflict, what Nancy Fraser refers to as a “boundary struggle” (Fraser and Jaeggi 2018), between the communal and the enclosure of the individual reflects the way capital accumulation attempts to eat into social reproduction itself (Federici 2004).

    Aziz’s story demonstrates a desire for achieved quality as an urban, yet pious and patriarchal, Uyghur Muslim, which became common among many young Uyghur men at this time (Byler 2015). This caused a nested, further dispossession of Uyghur women who were slotted into a subordinate role, their value indexed to the public-facing economic value of the work of pious Uyghur men. In an echo of capitalist frontier making in other contexts, the expropriated work of women—shopping, cooking, cleaning, the emotional and physical work of caring for children and the elderly, maintaining the status of the family through the constant work of hosting Uyghur visitors to the city—was devalued relative to the largely male work of wage labor and capital accumulation outside the home. In the past community-oriented village life, women’s work both in the home and in the fields had a higher value. In the new market economy, the higher cost of living combined with the increased role of consumption produced a greater strain on domestic relationships. These rising forms of misogyny were exacerbated by the violence and devaluation that men, and Uyghurs more generally, experienced in the Chinese marketplace. Uyghur male control and domination were often off-loaded on the household in the form of imposed restrictions on the appearance and movement of women and children.

Local police entered Uyghur migrants’ homes on a weekly basis, searching for unregistered Uyghurs from the countryside. Checkpoints were built on street corners, Uyghur men were asked to produce their papers and allow their cell phones to be scanned for links to terrorism. Jobs were hard to find, particularly if a migrant was alone in the city. They hustled just to get by, to stay just out of reach of police surveillance.

The word Ablikim used to describe the “raging” river, dawalghup, also carries with it the feeling of social vulnerability, of life in chaos and agitation. These feelings of disconnection and desperation, in turn, produced a Uyghur experience of what Alan Bray describes as a “crisis of friendship” in which social networks become a valuable yet fragile source of stability (2003, 2). Increasingly, Bray argues, elective relationships in market-oriented environments have become essential elements in processes of social identification and economic productivity. This development in social reproduction pushes capitalist subjects to extend their social network beyond coworkers, fellow citizens, and their immediate family members—to use their friends as a way of achieving economic stability.

Drawing inspiration from feminist, decolonial, and existential anthropology, 2 I demonstrate that these friendships are built largely out of an intersubjective being “together” (Uy: bille) that is fostered by sharing stories and life rhythms. Storytelling and friendship offer forms of protection from the violence of police contractors and market expropriation, resulting in a new experience of manhood and social reproduction itself. At the same time, if these friendships are severed, they can also become the locus of violence and emasculation.

    Throughout the modern history of capitalism and colonization, conditions of dispossession have disproportionately affected minoritized groups at the margins of societies. Karl Marx ([ 1848] 1963) conceptualized the dispossessed as the “lumpenproletariat.” This “lumpenization” process refers to the ways in which groups of people, often the descendants of slaves and the Indigenous, have been refused a class status and instead find ways to work and live in a “gray zone” of the informal economy (Bourgois and Schoenberg 2009, 19).

    Initially, as the Chinese economy was opened to market forces, Uyghur elective relationships became more inflected by the utility of socioeconomic networks expressed as business “associations” (Uy: munasivet), a development that parallels the elaboration of guanxi relations in other parts of China. 4 As Jay Dautcher has shown, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the 1990s, in the near past Uyghur male friendships were often formed around utilitarian relations and economic success (2009, 136). At the level of peri-urban neighborhoods, or mehelle, formalized friendship networks formed important senses of belonging that were developed through rituals of competition at regular gatherings, or meshrep (141). 5 Yet, as the colonization of the Uyghur homeland intensified in the 2000s and young men were forced to leave their neighborhoods for the city, these relationships of utility and competition were increasingly replaced. The enclosure system and Han settler evaluations had the effect of forcing young Uyghur men to identify with each other in new and deeper ways.

The legal system and the health care system were not made for us. We just accept this. As in other contexts of racialization and impoverishment, Uyghurs saw state and Han-majority institutions as indifferent, exploitative, and violent spaces (Gupta 2012).

For this reason, a “slow death” was experienced like a “subtraction”—a physical wearing out and disappearance that defined their historical existence—by state-capital directed institutions and corporations, and by surveillance systems carried out by police contractors and Han settlers.

    They knew that it was better to be vulnerable together than alone. The feelings of vulnerability that came from the control of the state, the policing of male migrant Uyghur bodies, and the shame that came from the lack of a stable social role in the city shaped how they cared for each other.

    Much popular press discussion of the devastating effects of Chinese counterterrorism and colonization in Uyghur society situates Uyghurs as largely passive victims of human rights abuse. My research with Uyghur young men taught me to think carefully about the ways they actively contested their colonization.

    By the very fact of their survival, marginalized subjects refuse when they do not fit the norms of modernist development or submit to the sovereignty of the modern nation-state. Some of these minorities refuse to participate in formal ways, refusing to recognize the authority of state institutions to grant them rights and recognition (Simpson 2014; McGranahan 2016). Others claim autonomy in less formal, embodied ways, refusing in practice to recognize truth regimes that devalue their lives (Byler 2018d). What is common in Native refusal is a claim to the priorness of Native forms of knowledge and practice. Their mode of being existed before and through the arrival of the modern state, and as such its value and authority existed prior to the sovereignty of the state and primacy of global capital.

    Some of them consider Xinjiang to be their homeland but some do not. All are shaped by particular projects of human engineering that accompanied the arrival of China’s modern state form—for example, the logic of Maoist multiculturalism, which in the 1950s began the process of placing people within essentialized ethnic ascriptions without a politics of self-determination.

    When in 1980 the arts were liberalized for commercial consumption, the overall goals of Han-centric socialist liberation continued to dominate government-approved aesthetics. In 2021 the Ürümchi-based Xinjiang Culture Ministry continues to give final approval to all cultural production, though production has been semiprivatized and sources of funding are now much more diverse. When it comes to Uyghur culture work, the public sphere is still quite tightly directed, and as the People’s War on Terror has intensified, increasingly constrained by the propaganda work of state-imposed multicultural domination. Nearly all Xinjiang culture work must promote “interethnic unity” (Ch: minzu tuanjie) and opposition to antirevolutionary, and now “terrorist,” forces.

    As recent anthropological scholarship has shown (Joniak-Lüthi 2015; Cliff 2016b), many Han who grew up in Xinjiang found themselves allied, to a limited extent, with Uyghurs against the onrush of new Han migrants who had arrived to build both state-funded and privately funded infrastructure and real estate.

    What Chen Ye’s experience pointed him toward was an understanding of life that refused or is denied sociopolitical recognition. Up on the mountain, the Uyghurs he photographed were excluded from the rationality of normal life. As figures at least partially outside the vision of the state, the migrant workers up on the hill were living through a process of dispossession as a condition of participation in a Chinese frontier city.

    Living outside the norms of society and staying attached to life was thus at times compromised by the frailty of bodies. Many Uyghur migrants to the city said they had been dispossessed of their land due to infrastructure development and passbook systems. Coming to the city in search of work, often relying on tenuous relationships with distant relatives or neighbors, was their only way forward.

    Being “subtracted” (Ch: jian shao; Uy: kımeytti) speaks to the calculus through which people were reduced to a numbered segment of work units under the discipline of party–state-directed modes of production, but as I have noted throughout this book, it also describes the way terror capitalism reduced Uyghur migrants to their data and labor power, transforming their bodies into biometric code, a “surplus population” (Ch: shengyu renkou) that could be subtracted from the city (see also Li 2017).

    Unlike the vast majority of Han migrants with whom I spoke about these incidents, Chen Ye did not blame Uyghur migrants, Islamic tradition, or lack of patriotism for the violence. He did not condone the violence in any way, but he said he understood the frustration and resentment that motivated it. He watched in horror the way mobs of Han migrants beat Uyghur bakers outside his apartment building while the police watched from the sidelines in the days that followed the initial violence.

    But, in any case, what happened after 2009 did not address the real sources of the problems. It is just like 1989 or the Cultural Revolution, the leaders just say some very vague things about how things have been taken care of and now everything is harmonious. They just ignore the real problems and act like they never happened. That is a very Chinese way of doing things.

    Many of the people who inhabited the space were not actively resisting the development of the city; they were merely trying to live with what they knew and what they had. People lived, sorting the refuse of the city, waiting to be told to leave. The tens of thousands of Uyghur migrants on Heijia Shan self-identified as musapir or “travelers” from elsewhere.

    The Chinese term mangliu, or “blind wanderer,” is used in contemporary Chinese discourse with both the negative connotations of poverty and homelessness and self-ascribed positive associations of migrant toughness and courage. The Uyghur term musapir differs from this Chinese conceptualization in the way it is related to particular religious histories of encultured thought. For Uyghurs, musapir also describes a particular religious practice—the Sufi tradition of the wandering Islamic mystic—and it is here, at the nexus of the psychic, material, and religious, that it becomes fruitful as a specific conceptualization of the sociality of Uyghur migrants as they wait to be expelled from the city.

    As I showed in chapter 3, in the 2000s, as the economic dispossession of the rural Uyghur population intensified, the population of rural-to-urban migration increased significantly. At the same time, a major religious movement began to gain currency, particularly among young men. By 2012 Uyghur men had in large part stopped drinking and smoking.

    This is something akin to what Lauren Berlant describes as “lateral agency” (2011) in which a subject attempts to maintain the will to live by seeking comfort in food or entertainment. For Millar, though, relational autonomy is a kind of involuntary minor politics, finding a communal grounds for hanging on to vital forms of sociality. For Uyghur migrants, the mosque community allowed them to build and sustain relationships, develop social roles, pursue life projects in the midst of uncertainty, and evaluate their subtraction in relation to the longer spiritual horizon. It gave them strength to endure.
