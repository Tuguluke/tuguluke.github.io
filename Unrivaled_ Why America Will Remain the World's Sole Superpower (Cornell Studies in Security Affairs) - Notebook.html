    By most measures, the United States is a mediocre country. It ranks seventh in literacy, eleventh in infrastructure, twenty-eighth in government efficiency, and fifty-seventh in primary education. 1 It spends more on health-care than any other country, but ranks forty-third in life expectancy, fifty-sixth in infant mortality, and first in opioid abuse. 2 More than a hundred countries have lower levels of income inequality than the United States, and twelve countries enjoy higher levels of gross national happiness. 3 Yet in terms of wealth and military capabilities—the pillars of global power—the United States is in a league of its own. With only 5 percent of the world’s population, the United States accounts for 25 percent of global wealth, 35 percent of world innovation, and 40 percent of global military spending. 4 It is home to nearly 600 of the world’s 2,000 most profitable companies and 50 of the top 100 universities. 5 And it is the only country that can fight major wars beyond its home region and strike targets anywhere

    China and Russia, for example, had the largest GDPs and military budgets in the world during much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but both countries suffered from severe production, welfare, and security costs that condemned them to defeat at the hands of smaller but more efficient nations.

    Chinese businesses suffer from chronically high production costs, and China’s 1.4 billion people generate massive welfare and security burdens. The United States, by contrast, is big and efficient, producing high output at relatively low costs. American workers and businesses are seven times more productive than China’s on average, and with four times fewer people than China, the United States has much lower welfare and security costs. Gross domestic product and other popular indicators create the false impression that China is overtaking the United States economically. In reality, China’s economy is barely keeping pace as the burden of propping up loss-making companies and feeding, policing, protecting, and cleaning up after one-fifth of humanity erodes China’s stocks of wealth.

<div class="noteText">
    The widespread perception that China is poised to dominate East Asia and close the military gap with the United States stems from a neglect of production, welfare, and security costs. My analysis takes these factors into account. I show, for example, that Chinese weapons systems are roughly half as capable as the United States’ on average; Chinese troops, pilots, and sailors receive less than half the training of their American counterparts and have limited operational experience and no combat experience; China’s personnel costs are at least 25 percent higher than the United States’; and homeland security operations consume at least 35 percent of China’s military budget and bog down half of China’s active-duty force, whereas the U.S. military outsources such operations and their costs to civilian agencies.

    Of course, U.S. military assets are dispersed around the world whereas China’s are concentrated in East Asia. The United States, however, is involved in most regions by choice and can redeploy forces from one area to another without seriously jeopardizing its security. China, by contrast, has to keep most of its military on guard at home, because it suffers from twice the level of domestic unrest as the United States and shares sea or land borders with nineteen countries, five of which fought wars against China within the last century and ten of which still claim parts of Chinese territory as their own.

    dominate discussions about why great powers rise and fall—balance-of-power theory and convergence theory. Both of these theories suggest that unipolarity will be short lived. 22 Balance-of-power theory holds that weak states usually gang up on strong states and force a redistribution of international power. 23 Convergence theory holds that poor countries grow faster than rich countries, thus rising challengers inevitably overtake reigning hegemons. 24 I argue that these theories do not apply today. Balance-of-power dynamics are muted, because the United States is too powerful and far away for other major powers to balance against. 25 Currently, no country can afford a sustained military challenge to U.S. primacy, and all of America’s potential rivals are packed together in Eurasia and therefore are more likely to fight each other than band together against the distant United States.

<div class="noteText">
    The balance of power is the motor of world politics, playing a role as central as the role of energy in physics and money in economics. 1 Power, however, is like love; it is “easier to experience than to define or measure.”

    A better interpretation of the war’s outcome would be that power has limits, and that North Vietnam defeated the United States, not because it was more powerful, but because it was more resolved (i.e., more willing to suffer and bear costs in pursuit of its objectives). In short, power alone does not determine outcomes; grit, luck, and wisdom matter too. The power as resources approach usefully untangles power from these other elements whereas the power as outcomes approach lumps them together.

    Most standard indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and military spending, are gross indicators, meaning that they do not deduct costs. Such indicators overstate the power of populous countries, because they count the benefits of having a big population—namely, the ability to mobilize a large work-force and raise a big army—but not the costs of having many people to feed, police, protect, and serve.

    One billion peasants will produce immense output, but they also will consume most of that output on the spot, leaving few resources left over to buy global influence or build a powerful military.

    Resources can be measured as stocks or flows. Stocks refer to accumulated resources; they are a nation’s stash, or stockpile, of wealth and military assets. Flows, on the other hand, measure annual increases and decreases (i.e., inflows and outflows) of resources.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 26 · Location 337
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In sum, flows provide a glimpse of a country’s recent performance, but not a sense of a country’s total wealth and military assets. For that reason, I measure the balance of power in terms of net stocks of resources and use flow measures only to gauge trends in the balance of power.

    Despite the widespread use of GDP, however, few people know what it actually measures. In particular, it is rarely recognized that GDP measures gross flows of resources and therefore does not deduct costs or measure long-term wealth accumulation.

    Consequently, populous countries generate considerable economic activity simply by existing. Even a nation caught in a Malthusian hell, in which all output is immediately devoured and living standards and technological progress are stagnant, will post a large GDP if it has a big population. In addition, GDP counts many security costs as economic output. GDP does not distinguish between guns and butter; a $ 100 million gulag shows up the same as a $ 100 million innovation center. Hence, GDP fails to account fully for the economic costs of conflict.

    Deducting security costs thus accounts for the fact that two nations with identical militaries may, nevertheless, wield vastly different levels of military power if one country is surrounded by enemies and wracked by domestic instability whereas the other is stable and surrounded by allies.

    Balance-of-power theory holds that weak states gang up on strong states and force a redistribution of power in the international system. Convergence theory, on the other hand, holds that poor countries grow faster than rich countries, thus rising challengers inevitably overtake established hegemons. I argue that neither theory applies today. Balance-of-power dynamics are muted, because weaker states lack the wealth and military capabilities necessary to mount a sustained challenge to U.S. primacy. Convergence theory, on the other hand, is underspecified.

    Below, I illustrate this point by showing that balancing against the United States has been minimal since 1991 whereas bandwagoning has been widespread. I define balancing broadly as actions taken by states that increase their power relative to that of the United States. This expansive definition includes a variety of behaviors that come in three general forms: internal balancing, external balancing, and soft balancing. Internal balancing occurs when U.S. rivals build up their military capabilities. External balancing occurs when countries form alliances against the United States. Soft balancing involves the use of non-military tools (e.g. economic statecraft, diplomacy, cyber attacks) to undermine U.S. power.

The gap in ratios of per capita GDP between rich and poor countries has narrowed slightly since 2000, but remains as wide as it was in the 1970s and greater than during the height of the imperialist era in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Few nations have gone from rags to riches. Besides oil states and trading entrepô ts, like Hong Kong and Singapore, the only success stories are Japan, South Korea and Taiwan—all three of which had the good fortune to develop during the Cold War, when the United States lavished money, technology, and trade privileges on its partners because it needed strong anticommunist allies. 102

The reason is that presidential systems have an Achilles heel: they require contending branches of government to compromise and strike bargains.

    This doctrine, which was originally developed by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in the 1980s and then elaborated by chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell in the 1990s, consisted of a series of questions that had to be answered “yes” before sending American soldiers to fight and die abroad: Is a vital national security interest threatened? Do we have a clear attainable objective? Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed? Have all other nonviolent policy means been fully exhausted? Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement? Have the consequences of our action been fully considered? Is the action supported by the American people? Do we have genuine broad international support? The core assumption of the Powell Doctrine is that the United States rarely needs to rush into war to keep itself safe.

    A Saudi civil war could threaten the free flow of oil, given that most of the Kingdom’s disgruntled Shia minority lives in the Eastern Province near the country’s oil production facilities. A mass uprising, however, is unlikely, because Saudi Arabia’s internal security forces are robust, roughly 90 percent of Saudi workers are government employees that depend on the monarchy for their livelihoods, and the Saudi government has huge cash reserves to keep the gravy train running during economic downturns.

If anything, the terrorist threat has probably exacerbated divisions within American society by inciting witch hunts for terrorist suspects and igniting vicious debates on immigration, torture, war, and privacy.

    Gerrymandering is as old as the Republic—the practice is named after Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, who approved a district in 1812 that was so convoluted that a local newspaper said it looked like a salamander—but computer technology has made it easier for politicians to pick their voters, and gerrymandering has clearly gotten out of hand: in 2016, fewer than 10 percent of U.S. House races and only 28 percent of Senate general election races were competitive. The rest were in safe seats, and the winner was effectively decided in the primary. To increase the number of mixed districts, states should hand over redistricting responsibility to independent nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions, an approach that Arizona, California, Idaho, and Washington have already instituted.

In just the past few years, these nations have murdered pro-democracy advocates, promoted a version of state capitalism that resembles sixteenth-century mercantilism, and used military force to seize foreign territory and close international waters. These actions provide a glimpse of a future “world in disarray” in which the United States no longer backs the liberal order.

The United States can be both “system-maker and privilege-taker.” 95 It can pay a large share of system maintenance costs but take a disproportionate share of the benefits.
