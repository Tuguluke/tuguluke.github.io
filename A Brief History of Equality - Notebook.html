<div class="noteText">
    To begin with macroeconomic indicators, it is greatly preferable to use the notion of national income rather than that of gross domestic product (GDP). There are two essential differences: national income is equal to the GDP (the sum of goods and services produced in a country in the course of one year) minus the depreciation of capital (that is, wear and tear on tools, machines, and furniture used in production, including, in principle, natural capital), plus or minus the net income from capital and labor collected from or paid out to the rest of the world (this set can be either positive or negative, depending on each country’s situation, but by definition these cancel each other out at the global level).
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 23 · Location 488

<div class="noteText">
    The importance of the choice of the indicator is clear: the same economic operation can lead to a positive GDP or a negative national income.

    For the same reasons of transparency, I advise against the use of synthetic indices that are supposed to sum up the level of inequality in a society (like Gini’s and Theil’s coefficients, which are relatively abstract to interpret). In my view it is more appropriate to use more intuitive notions such as the proportion of incomes going to the poorest 50 percent or to the richest 10 percent, the proportion of the emissions caused by the heaviest 1 percent of emitters, and so on, which everyone can easily understand.

    We will return to these various developments all through this book, and we shall see that the march toward equality over the past two centuries has taken the form of a profound re-equilibration of the law in favor of those who are not property owners. This transformation of property law, chiefly in the course of the second half of the nineteenth century and all through the twentieth century, has been a central stake in social and political struggles. It has contributed not only to greater socioeconomic equality, but also to greater prosperity, thanks to everyone’s increased participation in social and economic life.

    In sum, the disadvantaged classes have very little in savings; the assets of the middle class are centered on housing; the wealthy classes distribute their assets between housing, business assets, and financial assets; the dominant classes concentrate on ownership of the means of production (business assets and especially stocks and financial securities).

    If we now examine the development of the distribution as a whole, we see that the reduction of inequalities took place mainly to the benefit of what may be called the patrimonial middle class, that is, the 40 percent between the poorest 50 percent and the richest 10 percent

    The reduction of inequalities is partly the consequence of wars and economic crises, but it also derives, especially, from new social and fiscal policies implemented since the end of the nineteenth century and in the course of the twentieth century: the increased power of the welfare state, the establishment of a certain equality of access to fundamental goods such as education and health care, and the development of a strongly progressive tax on high income and wealth.

    The first factor was the welfare state’s spectacular rise in power. This long-term development was in large measure the result of social struggles and mobilization of the socialist and labor movements since the end of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, it was greatly accelerated by the two world wars and the Depression following the stock market crash of 1929—three events that in the three decades between 1914 and 1945 completely overturned the power relationships between labor and capital. The second factor was the development of a very progressive tax on income and inheritance, which made it possible to massively reduce the concentration of wealth and economic power at the apex of the social hierarchy while at the same time favoring increased mobility and greater prosperity. The progressive tax played a decisive role in defining a new social and fiscal contract.

    Let us now come to the question of progressive taxation. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, almost all the world’s fiscal systems were clearly regressive, in the sense that they were usually based on sales taxes and indirect taxes representing a proportionately heavier burden on the poorest people than on the wealthiest. The most extreme case of a regressive tax is the poll tax or capitation, which is a tax of a fixed amount for everyone. By definition, it represents a proportion of a low-paid employee’s income ten times larger than that of a manager with a salary ten times higher. 10 A proportional tax is a tax representing a set percentage of income or assets, to be paid by all social classes. Conversely, a progressive tax is characterized by a rate of taxation that rises as income or wealth rises.

    The top rate was then cut in half, with the announced objective of boosting growth. But in fact, growth fell by half, reaching 1.1 percent per annum between 1990 and 2020 (see Figure 23). Beyond a certain level of inequality, repeatedly increasing differences in income and wealth has clearly had no positive effect on economic dynamism.

This system differs entirely from the kind of centralized, authoritarian state socialism that was tried within the Soviet bloc during the twentieth century. It is situated mainly within ongoing social, fiscal, and legal transformations begun in many Western European countries in the past century, through a hard-earned history of changing power relations, popular movements, and multiple crises and moments of great tension.

In order to accelerate the implementation of the common currency, they agreed to the demands of the German Christian Democrats, who sought a complete liberalization of capital flows. This demand materialized in a European directive of 1988 that was retranscribed in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992.

    The current economic system, based on the uncontrolled circulation of capital, goods, and services, without social or environmental objectives, is akin to a neocolonialism that benefits the wealthiest. We will see that only a project of global transformation, to which each country can make its contribution by practicing a new form of sovereignism with a universalist vocation, that is, by relying on explicit indicators of social justice, can make it possible to overcome these contradictions.

    To begin, full transparency by public authorities is critical: such quantified facts must made publicly available on an annual basis, not just revealed from time to time by individual researchers. Specifically, it is important that we make public every year the distribution of expenditures for education and the rates of access to the various courses of study in relation to social origins and percentile of parental income, breaking down this information by level of schooling.

In France, after decades of feminist rallies, and after hopes betrayed in 1789, 1848, and 1871, the Chamber of Deputies approved women’s right to vote in 1919, but the Senate vetoed the law. In France, not until 1944 did women’s suffrage become a reality. 7

    In comparison, the French model, which treats religious associations in the same way as other associations, is potentially more satisfactory. It amounts to seeing religion as a belief or a cause like others, and favors the renewal and diversity of structures. This system could be made more egalitarian by changing public subsidies into vouchers of equal amounts for all, and each person could then donate to the organization of choice, whether religious, cultural, or humanitarian, according to personal values and beliefs. Such a system would advance real equality and move away from the current climate of suspicion and stigmatization.

    We must also emphasize the extreme hypocrisy that surrounds the very notion of international aid. First, public aid for development is much more limited than is often imagined: in all, it represents less than 0.2 percent of the global GDP (and scarcely 0.03 percent of the global GDP for emergency humanitarian aid). 12 In comparison, the cost of climatic damage inflicted on poor countries by past and current emissions from rich countries amounts by itself to several points of the global GDP.

    Let us conclude by noting that the refusal to engage with social and democratic federalism may help nourish reactionary projects aimed at compensating, in an authoritarian manner, for the limitations of the nation-state. In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt as early as 1951 noted that the main weakness of European Social-Democrats during the interwar period was precisely that they had not fully taken into account the need for a world-politics to respond to the challenges of the world-economy. 30 In a certain way, they were the only ones: both the colonial empires and the Bolshevik and Nazi political constructions were based on postnational state forms that were adapted to the dimensions of the world-economy and to the internationalization of industrial and financial capitalism.

    Specifically, I am interested in the challenges posed by the rise of “Chinese socialism,” a statist, authoritarian model that is opposed on every point to the democratic, decentralized socialism defended in this book, and that, in my opinion, is far less emancipatory. However, the Western powers would be wise to take it seriously. If they persist in defending an obsolete, hypercapitalist model, it is not at all certain they will succeed. The true alternative is democratic socialism, participatory and federalist, ecological and multicultural.

    If we compare the economic structures in force in China and in the West, the most striking difference is without any doubt the property system, and in particular the importance of private property. The share of public capital (all levels of governments and collectivities taken together) was about 70 percent in China in 1978, at the time when reforms were begun. It declined sharply during the years 1980–1990 and until the middle of the 2000s, and has been stable at around 30 percent of the national capital since then (see Figure 39). It is striking to note that the privatization of property in China ended around 2005–2006: the balance between public and private property has hardly budged since that time. Given the very strong growth of the Chinese economy, capital obviously continues to accumulate in all its forms: new plots of land are being developed, factories and skyscrapers are being constructed, all at breakneck speed. Putting it simply, we can say that the capital being developed under public control is progressing at about the same rate as that in private hands. In this sense, China seems to be stabilizing around a structure of property that could be described as a mixed economy: the country is no longer truly communist, but it is not completely capitalist, either, since public property represents a little more than 30 percent of the total: less than half, of course, but nonetheless a very substantial share. The fact that the Chinese state owns almost a third of everything that can be owned in the country affords it considerable opportunities for intervening in decisions as to where investments are to be made and where jobs are to be created, and for pursuing policies of regional development.

    On the one hand, residential real estate has been almost entirely privatized. In the early 2020s, the state and companies held less than 5 percent of the residential housing stock, which became the private investment par excellence for Chinese households that had the means, and this helped make real estate prices skyrocket, especially since opportunities for financial savings are limited and the public retirement system is underfunded. Conversely, the government currently holds around 55–60 percent of companies’ total capital (including all enterprises, listed and unlisted, all sizes and all sectors taken together).

    In the economic and financial domain, the Chinese state has considerable assets that far outweigh its debts, and this gives it the means to pursue ambitious policies, both domestically and internationally, particularly concerning investments in infrastructure and in the transition to new forms of energy. In contrast, it is striking to note to what point the main Western states all find themselves, in the early 2020s, in a position in which the share of public property is almost nil or even negative (see Figure 39). Having failed to balance their public accounts (which would have required them to raise tax rates for the wealthiest taxpayers), these countries have accumulated public debts, while at the same time selling off an increasing share of their public assets, so that the former have ended up slightly exceeding the latter.

    This allows China to rack up points against what is perceived by the world as the eternal arrogance of Western countries, which are always quick to lecture the whole Earth concerning justice and democracy, but prove incapable of dealing with the inequalities and discrimination that undermine them, even though they manage to come to terms with all the potentates and oligarchs from whom they benefit. On these subjects, the right response to China’s statist, authoritarian socialism would be to promote a form of democratic, participatory socialism that is ecological and postcolonial, one which finally pays attention to the global South and to all the West’s inequalities and hypocrisies.

There are even plans to set up central bank digital currencies in the near future.

    The spectacular increase in monetary creation since 2008 illustrates once again to what point economic institutions are not unchanging. They are constantly redefined according to crises and power relationships, within unstable and precarious compromises. This new ease in increasing the money supply has nonetheless led to a confusion that it is important to clarify here. In short, money is an indispensable tool of economic, social, and climate policy, on the condition, however, that it is not made sacred and is put back in its place in a coherent institutional framework based especially on the welfare state, progressive taxation, parliamentary deliberation, and democratic supervision.

    Regarding public debts, the balance in force in the early 2020s is relatively precarious. The central banks have bought back an ever-larger share of state loans, at an interest rate that is almost zero. If the rates start to climb again, or rather when they begin to climb again, the interest burden will be unbearable for citizen taxpayers, and it will be necessary to implement other solutions, like the exceptional levies on private wealth that were applied after World War II. Moreover, current monetary policy poses other problems. For small savers, zero or negative interest rates are not necessarily good news. On the other hand, for those who have the means to borrow at low interest rates and to find good investments, it is possible to obtain excellent yields. In all, monetary creation and the purchase of financial securities have helped boost prices on the stock and real estate markets, and to further enrich the rich.

    This kind of universalist sovereignism will also require active citizens. The social sciences can contribute to this, but it goes without saying that they will not suffice. Only powerful social mobilizations, supported by collective movements and organizations, will allow us to define common objectives and transform power relationships. By what we ask of our friends, our networks, our elected officials, our preferred media, our labor union representatives, and by our own actions and participation in collective deliberation and social movements, each of us can make socioeconomic phenomena more comprehensible and help grasp the changes that are occurring. Economic questions are too important to be left to others. Citizens’ reappropriation of this knowledge is an essential stage in the battle for equality.
