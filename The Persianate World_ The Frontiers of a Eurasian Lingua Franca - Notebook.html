    As an exercise in world history, the aim is to decouple the study of Persian from both explicit and implicit methodological nationalisms. In recent years the promotion of the “Persianate world” based implicitly around competing cultural centers in India or Iran has at times carried the ideological baggage of formerly dominant secular nationalisms, whether Iranian emphases on a “cosmopolitan worldliness” distinct from the Islamic Republic or Indian emphases on a “composite culture” distinct from Hindutva.

    The term “Persianate” was first coined in the 1960s by the world historian Marshall Hodgson in his Venture of Islam. Hodgson explained and defined the term as follows: “The rise of Persian had more than purely literary consequences: it served to carry a new overall cultural orientation within Islamdom. . . . Most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims likewise depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration. We may call all these cultural traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, ‘Persianate’ by extension.”

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 270
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    After Hodgson’s momentous venture in rethinking Islamic civilization in world-historical terms, several other scholars have since the late 1990s proposed amendments or alternatives to his concept of the “Persianate.” The first was Bert Fragner, who put forward a model of Persophonie, or “Persophonia,” based on the regions connected through a shared language, in which the basic conceptual distinction is between Persian as a “mother tongue” (Muttersprache) and as a “second language” (Zweitsprache). 5 Traced in its evolution over several centuries, this carefully demonstrated distinction allowed Fragner to distinguish his wider arena of Persophonie from Iran and Iranians, both in their earlier manifestations as the Shu‘ubiyya movement of the ‘Abbasid period and in their later manifestations in modern Iranian nationalism. 6 This basic but key distinction allowed Fragner to place emphasis on the Asian traditions of multilingualism among which Persian served as a “transregional contact language” (transregionale Kontaktsprache) between a variety of different peoples and their own local languages.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 283
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The Persianate World differs from Fragner’s implicit emphasis on spoken Persian by instead emphasizing the importance of written Persian so as to develop a model of “Persographia” in place of “Persophonia.” For as shown in more detail below, the scribal practices and manuscript-based exchanges that expanded and sustained the Persianate world across the length of Eurasia did not necessarily require the ability to speak Persian.

    As anthropologist and linguist respectively, Spooner and Hanaway developed a conception of Persian as a social practice and cultural technology that was, crucially, “anchored in stable forms of writing.” 10 This emphasis on written Persian as distinct from a spoken lingua franca was based on a core hypothesis that “written language has had a dynamic that is distinct from that of spoken language—essentially a culture of its own.”

    Hamid Dabashi’s The World of Persian Literary Humanism. 13 In contrast to Spooner and Hanaway’s focus on material writing practices, Dabashi’s emphasis is on literature as a transhistorical medium of “literary humanism.” Dabashi proposes that the “subversive” and “flamboyant” profile of Persianate literary culture (adab), which had “an effectively feminine disposition,” was always distinct from “the commanding doctrinal beliefs, strict juridical injunctions, expansive metaphysical mandates” of Islam. 14 This is quite contrary, then, to Hodgson. Although he devotes parts of two chapters to the Mongols and Mughals, for Dabashi, the geography or “world” of Persian literary humanism remained focused on Iran as its “epicenter.”

    As Ahmed defines it, his Balkans-to-Bengal area is “most meaningfully conceptualized not in terms of the Persianate, Turkic, or Perso-Islamic, but of Islam.” 20 This is to reject nationalist particularism only to favor Islamic particularism, even if it is Ahmed’s appealing version of Islam.

    For centuries, people from across India, Central Asia, and even Siberia looked to Balkh-i Bami (Balkh the Ancient), Bukhara-yi Sharif (Bukhara the Noble), or Hazrat-i Dilhi (Delhi the Sacred), as the center of Persian learning, rather than to anywhere in Iran.

    Although medieval figures like Sa‘di of Shiraz (d. 1292) long retained their importance as poetic and pedagogic touchstones, their writings had long been naturalized in their multiple spaces of reception and reproduction by the seventeenth century. The model of the Persianate world proposed here is therefore one in which the place (let alone the centrality) of Iran is less a given than a variable. Persian had no perpetual or primordial homeland, no watan to which it was destined inevitably to return, but instead charted a history that was contingent and contested across the multiple spaces that used and so claimed it.

    The degree to which even the eastern former Sasanian provinces embraced Arabic is seen in the influence exerted in the ‘Abbasid capital of Baghdad by members of the formerly Buddhist Barmaki family of Balkh and in the compilation by the Central Asian scholar al-Bukhari (d. 870) of one of the canonical Hadith collections of the Prophet Muhammad.

    Hebrew-script Persian (known Judeo-Persian) predated the emergence of Arabic-script Persian and survived into the twentieth century. The earliest written records of New Persian are in fact in Hebrew rather than Arabic script. They comprise a rock inscription from 751–52 in the high mountain pass of Tang-i Azao some two hundred kilometers east of Herat in what is today central Afghanistan; and a letter from a Jewish merchant likely datable to 760 found in the Dandan-Öilïq oasis near Khotan along the Silk Road in what is today western China. 34 Other early dialects of New Persian were written in Syriac and Manichaean scripts. 35 As late as 874, Middle Persian in Pahlavi script was still being used for funerary inscriptions in the Tang imperial capital of Xi’an, where families of the former Sasanian Zoroastrian elite had settled as refugees two centuries earlier.

    As John Perry has noted, the “spoken Persian of the time served as a vernacular for Zoroastrians, Jews, Manichaeans, Christians and Muslim converts in Iran.” 38 This was not yet true of Persian written in Arabic script, which would take several centuries—and several shifts across both geographical and social frontiers—to emerge as a written contact language for speakers of different languages and members of different religions.

    Khurasan and Transoxiana. 41 These were by no means Persian’s linguistic homeland, but rather frontier regions where Persian had centuries earlier been imported and replaced the Soghdian language. Then, during the subsequent early centuries of Islamic rule, Persian had been reintroduced there by converted Muslim settlers.

    New Persian also adopted from Arabic the system of numerical notation known as siyaq, in which the Arabic words for decimal numerals (rather than Indian-derived numerical symbols) were abbreviated into distinct graphemes. 53 By these means, as part of the package of secretarial education, numeracy became embedded in Arabic (and then in turn Persian) literacy. 54 The siyaq system of Persianate numeracy would prove durable: after being passed from Umayyad into Samanid usage, siyaq was in turn transmitted to the Safavids, Ottomans, and Mughals, and did not disappear entirely until the script and educational reforms of the 1920s and 1930s.

    It was only during the eleventh century, after the Samanids’ fall, that New Persian’s repertoire was expanded both in terms of literature and bureaucracy. The key patrons of this expansion were not ethnic Persians like the Samanids. They were Turks. With the political ascent of Turkic former slave soldiers under the Ghaznavids (977–1186) and Great Saljuqs (1016–53), the role of the secretarial class became even more influential. For the secretaries served as administrative linchpins, political mentors, and propagandist encomiasts for the new Turkic dynasts.

    Although New Persian was to be the dominant written partner of Turkic, spoken social interactions gradually led to the absorption of numerous Turkic words into written Persian. 59 The incorporation of Turkish vocabulary into New Persian would never rival its earlier Arabization in scale, however, and neither did these linguistic interactions and lexical borrowings follow a simple linear pattern.

    The Turkic ascendance of the eleventh and twelfth century was, in processual terms, more influential for its institutional than its bibliographical innovations. For by way of the madrasa and the khanaqah—the school and the convent—the Ghaznavids and particularly the Saljuqs patronized two new types of enduring institutions that not only enabled the production of more Persian texts but, more important, reared new generations of producers and readers of written Persian.

    The later Ghaznavid capital of Lahore and the later Saljuq capital of Konya provide prime examples of Persian’s new expanded geography by the twelfth century. 64 Then, from 1206, the establishment of the Delhi sultanate made Delhi a new regional hub of Persian learning. From there, within a century, a sequence of Persographic urban nodes irradiated as far as Gujarat, Bengal, and the Deccan.

    Although Arabic retained its hold over certain religious disciplines (notably law), especially at the higher level, Persian’s religious ambit expanded enormously under the Turkic dynasties. The Hadiqat al-Haqiqa (Walled Garden of Truth) of Hakim Sana’i (d. 1131) showed the increasing literary sophistication of didactic poetry, and the Tazkirat al-Awliya (Lives of God’s Friends) of Farid al-Din ‘Attar (d. 1220) signaled the rise of a type of hagiography that would soon spread into Anatolia and India as part of the Persianate making of new Muslim sacred geographies.

    For both Armenian and Georgian were much older as written languages than New Persian, with Christian Armenian literature beginning around 405 with the invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots (362–440), and Georgian after the evolution of the Old Georgian (Asomtavruli) script, first attested in the Bolnisi Sioni church inscriptions of 494.74 As a result of Iranian influences going back to the Achaemenian Empire, around 60 percent of the Classical Armenian lexicon consisted of borrowings from Old and Middle Persian (largely Parthian). However, from the fifth century on, Mashtots’s Armenian alphabet acted as an enduring barrier against further lexical borrowing from Persian, forming a kind of orthographic frontier that constitutes an important contrast with the more familiar Persianate languages that adopted the Arabic script.

    Yet it is important not to overstate the point for, unlike Armenian, Georgian also absorbed hundreds of literary loanwords from Persian, whether basic terms for “love” (Georgian: mijnuroba, from the name Majnun) and songbirds (Georgian: bulbul) or the name of a particular poetic form (Georgian: shairi from Arabo-Persian shi‘r). 77

    Yet overall, having established its own alphabet, lexicon, norms, and concerns before the medieval ascent of Persian, Armenian literature made only selective adoptions of Persian motifs and loanwords, the latter being in any case mediated mainly through Turkish. (Conversely, what we might term “Georgianate” Turkish texts would later be written in the Georgian Mkhedruli script).

    In the expansion of these bureaucratic and in turn literary activities, we should also recognize the material profile of Persographia based on increasing access to the paper that had spread from China to Samarqand and then Khurasan by the mid-eighth century, into Armenian and Georgian monastic usage in the Caucasus by 981, then down into India by the thirteenth century. 91 When paper technology reached Delhi, then Bengal and the Deccan, the Persian term kaghaz (a Soghdian word that was possibly itself a borrowing from Chinese) was loaned and adapted into many other languages of the subcontinent, from Bengali and Nepali to Marathi and Telugu, as well as further west into such languages as Georgian, Kurdish, the several varieties of Turkic, and Arabic (with early adoption into Arabic shaping the spelling of the word in Persian). 92 Ottoman usage carried the word kaghaz even as far west as the Balkans, where it generated the modern Serbian term for “documentation” (ćage), part of the larger Ottoman-borne Persian lexicon that survives to this day in such other Balkan languages as Bulgarian and Romanian. 93

    The impact was felt not only in the arts of the book—via marbled papers and brushwork clouds—but also in new textual visions of that wider Eurasian world, most famously in the Persian survey of world history, Jami‘ al-Tawarikh (Compendium of Histories), written by the Mongol vizier Rashid al-Din (1247–1318). 99 Its author, a convert from Judaism, was only one of many Persographic secretaries employed by the various Mongol states of the fourteenth century. 100 Through them, the Pax Mongolica afforded the expansion of Persian administrative practices further east across Eurasia as far as China and Mongolia. Despite claims to the contrary, Persian did probably not become one of the “official” languages of the Chinese Mongol (Yuan) bureaucracy.

    Whatever the scale of early Persianate influence on the formation of Malay literature, written Persian was never an Indian Ocean lingua franca in the way that Arabic was, or even in the way written Malay subsequently became a “cosmopolitan vernacular” connecting peoples across peninsular and insular Southeast Asia. After all, the number of Persian loanwords in classical Malay stands at a little less than a hundred, compared to around a thousand Arabic words.

Within that networked geography, courts, chanceries, madrasas, and khanaqahs functioned as the mechanisms and markers of Persian’s expansion.

    But in the late fifteenth century and especially the sixteenth, Persian’s local linguistic interlocutors began to be written down in a multitude of different regions, thus generating what Hodgson conceived as Persianate languages. 134 In Timurid Herat, this meant the Chaghatai Turkic promoted by court literati like Mir ‘Ali Shir Nawa’i (1441–1501), which subsequently spread through much of Central and even South Asia, if very much as the junior partner to Persian. 135 For whatever the rhetorical claims of Nawa’i’s Muhakamat al-Lughatayn (Contention of the Two Languages), the appearance of Chaghatai texts at the court of Sultan Husayn Bayqara (r. 1469–70, 1470–1506) never amounted to anything approaching a systematic Timurid program to promote Turkic at the expense of Persian: both the Timurid court and chancery remained wedded to Persian. 136 Indeed, the scope of Persographia expanded, since Persian began to be deployed as a language of jurisprudence (fiqh) under the late Timurids precisely after Bayqara’s chief magistrate in Herat compiled Mukhtar al-Ikhtiyar, a legal textbook that remained in use till the twentieth century. 137 Nonetheless, several written varieties of Turkic were emerging as new literary languages that qualify as Persianate in Hodgson’s original terms of definition, that is as languages that “depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration.”

    In addition to rival regional languages, the interregional hegemony of written Persian was also being threatened by literary Turki (whether what would eventually be termed “Chaghatai” or “Ottoman” Turkish), itself an increasingly interregional language, whose chefs-d’oeuvre were read from the Tarim Basin to the Balkans. 145 Although Chaghatai was never nearly as widespread as Persian in Mughal India, it was arguably more socially and ethnically exclusive, being chiefly associated with elite families of moghol immigrants. Even so, a tradition of Chaghatai text production continued in the subcontinent during the entire Mughal era.

As the Sikh religion gradually emerged through the teachings of the ten gurus under Afghan Lodi and Mughal rule, not only did Persian verses find their way into the Sikh holy book but a subsidiary Sikh religious literature was also composed in Persian. 184 The last Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), composed his Zafar-nama (Letter of Victory) to the emperor Awrangzeb (whose successor had him assassinated) in the imperial lingua franca, while Persian was also the language of the Rahit-nama (Book of Conduct) and Bandagi-nama (Book of Discipleship) of Gobind Singh’s favorite disciple, the Ghazni-born Bhai Nand Lal (1633–1713).

    The other important social frontier that Persian literacy increasingly crossed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was that of gender, because increasing numbers of elite women learned to read Persian, and in some cases composed works in that language. 186 Here it was the court and the sub-imperial elite households, rather than the bureaucracy, that were important. Timurid cultural traditions of high female status and education found new expressions in India, most famously with the princesses Gulbadan (ca. 1523–1603) and Jahanara (1614–81).

    A side-effect of this new intellectual axis was the creation, from around 1770 perhaps, of intellectual networks in which Persian-writing intellectuals in India and to some extent Iran translated and otherwise responded to recent developments in the “European sciences” (‘ ulum-i farangi). 203 Even so, the case should not be overstated, insofar as the major power of concern to Europe—the Ottoman Empire—conducted its diplomatic correspondence with Europe in Turkish, which generated a cadre of European linguistic middlemen more “Ottomanate” than Persianate.

    Faced with this situation, the new Eurasian empires of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—British, Russian, and Chinese—were forced in different degrees to adapt to the literate status quo. These were pragmatic policies. Except when it seemed politically expedient to engage with the culture of native elites, the new imperial ruling class would not be Persianized like the conquering Turks of an earlier era. They dealt with the language situation—particularly the availability of literate bureaucratic middlemen—as they found it. As a result, imperial Russia required its officials and intermediaries to deal far more with Turkic and Mongolian languages than with Persian. 216 After the Qing conquest of what they called the “New Territories” (Xinjiang) of Eastern Turkistan in the 1750s, Persian was used by Qing officials as diplomatic correspondence increased with China’s new frontiers with Qoqand, the principalities of Badakhshan and the Pamirs, and Ladakh. 217 But in Chinese-ruled Xinjiang itself, by the time of the Qing conquests, written Turki had become far more important than Persian among the literate local population. Whether to their rulers in Beijing or their co-religionists in Bukhara and Kazan, by 1900, the Muslim inhabitants of Xinjiang were overwhelmingly writing in Turki (which, with some modifications, they renamed Uyghur).

    Although in 1741–42 the final book issued by the pioneer Ottoman printer Ibrahim Müteferrika (1674–1745) had been the Persian-Turkish dictionary Lisan al-‘ Ajam (Language of Persia) of Hasan Shu‘uri, with the revival of Ottoman printing in the early nineteenth century, his successors favored books in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, or regional languages of the empire. If there was a dominant language, it was Turkish, as with the Greek-script Turkish works printed by the Karamanli Greeks of Anatolia. 238 Most of Central Asia relied on Turkic printed books imported from the vibrant private Tatar publishing houses of the Russian-controlled Volga-Ural region (chiefly in Kazan). Printing did not reach Eastern Turkistan until 1893, when the first press—for Turkic not Persian—was established in Yangihissar by a former tailor called Nur Muhammad Hajji, who had learned lithography on a journey through India en retour from the pilgrimage to Mecca. 239 After printing two popular Turkic classics by Sufi Allahyar and Mir ‘Ali Shir Nawa’i, Nur Muhammad was soon commissioned by the Qing government to print the Turkic translation of a morality text by the Qing Shunzhi emperor, followed by a translated military instruction manual.

    Stephen Haw has subjected these claims to extensive criticism, arguing that both the place of Muslims among the foreigners who served in the Yuan bureaucracy and that of Persian-speakers among these Muslims have been exaggerated. While there undoubtedly were Persian-speakers in the service of the khans, far more “Semu ren” (as the Yuan classified them) can be confidently identified as speakers of Turkic: among them the Uyghurs, who held a prominent position in the Yuan bureaucracy, but also various Qarluq, Qangli, Öngüt, and Qipchaq migrants to China. Contrary to the received wisdom on Marco Polo, the Venetian’s travelogue does not in fact offer conclusive evidence for the preeminence of Persian. Here, and elsewhere in sources on the Yuan, Turkic toponyms and terminology crop up just as frequently as Persian, including, for example, the name (khanbalïq) by which the Yuan capital was known among foreigners, or the name for the dynasty’s Mongol-Muslim trading enterprises (the ortoq). From his wide-ranging discussion, Haw draws the conclusion that Turkic, not Persian, was “the predominant language of the Semu ren” in the Yuan. 2

    The Chaghataiid khans and princes kept up correspondence in Persian with their neighbors in Western Turkistan, India, and occasionally China. 3 The dynasty’s founder Sa‘id Khan (1487–1514) spoke Persian, and could versify in the language, as could his son, ‘Abd al-Rashid Khan (1508–60). 4 Yet on the whole the Chaghataiids were no great patrons of Persian letters. There was never a sizable community of native Persian-speakers in the Tarim Basin, and the language never occupied the position in Yarkand that it did in neighboring Khoqand or Bukhara. Naturally, allowance must be made for the vagaries of manuscript survival, but to this date little evidence has come to light for court sponsorship of poetry or prose in Persian. Nor was Persian the language of administration: the textual record shows that the Chaghataiid chancellery made exclusive use of Turkic.

    the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) established the College of Translators (Siyiguan) within the prestigious Hanlin Academy as the dynasty’s main institution for the training of translators. Siyiguan literally means the “Bureau of the Four Barbarians,” where “four” refers to the four cardinal points (i.e., “all directions”). However, the Siyiguan usually had at least eight subdivisions. Of these, two dealt with the languages of peoples and polities that were part of, or were becoming part of, the Islamic world during the Ming: the Gaochang Office, whose name reflects the proximity to Ming China of the Turkic-speaking people of Gaochang, the Chinese name for Turfan; and the Muslim Office, which received envoys from the Timurid realm and beyond. These designations give the impression that geographic or cultural divisions determined each office’s jurisdiction, but the division of labor was based on the scripts that they dealt with. In the Gaochang Office, translators studied the Sogdian-derived Uyghur script; in the Muslim Office, translators learned Persian in the Arabic script.

    The spread of Islamic rule in Turkistan at the expense of the remaining Buddhist principalities is a case in point. Following the eastward expansion of the Muslim Chaghataiids in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Arabic script displaced Uyghur for written communication in the Tarim Basin, as well as in the principalities of Turfan and Hami. In his Siyiguan kao (1580), a late-Ming description of the Siyiguan, Wang Zongzai points out that in his day, tribute missions from Gaochang were led by Muslims, who wrote, not in the Uyghur script that was still studied in the Gaochang Office, but in Arabic script. “Although Gaochang originally fell within the Gaochang Office for translation,” he writes, “recently there have been a lot of Muslims among them. When they bring tribute they use the Muslim script, so they too come within the purview of the Muslim Office.” Ming officials referred to these Turkic letters in Arabic script as the “Gaochang language in the Muslim script” (Gaochanghua Huihuizi).

The restructuring led to the dismissal of the entire staff of the Gaochang Office, with only a small group retained from the Muslim Office.

    The first foreign Muslims with whom the Qing court had contact were members of Junghar Mongol trading missions, men who were bilingual in Turkic and Mongolian, drawn from that group of Turkistani Muslims who were in the service of the Junghars. For this reason the Qing court saw no need to add Muslim staff to either the Court of Colonial Affairs or the Mongolian Copying Office. Archival evidence indicates that when the Mongolian Copying Office encountered texts in “Muslim script,” it relied on ad hoc intermediaries to translate via Mongolian into Manchu.

    As the Qing extended their sway from Jungharia into the Tarim Basin in the 1750s, they encountered a complex linguistic situation, and officials became aware of the linguistic diversity of the Islamic lands. Yet for the most part, this diversity was treated in terms of discrete geographic spheres, with little recognition given to the idea that the local learned tradition was itself multilingual, with texts circulating in Arabic, Persian, and Turkic. The first officially published gazetteer of Xinjiang, the Qinding huangyu xiyu tuzhi (commissioned in 1755), situated each of these three Islamic languages in distinct territories: “There are a total of three languages in the Muslim territory. From Hami and Pichan as far west as Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan, the language is basically the same, and they call it Turki. Among foreign tributaries such as Badakhshan, Bolor, etc., the language they use is called Parsi. There is also the language of the Quran [He-er-ang], which is only spoken in the Muslim homeland of Mecca and Medina, and differs from Turki and Parsi.”

    By the middle of the eighteenth century, though, the default meaning of “Muslim language” had settled decisively on Turkic. It was in a form of literary Turkic that the corpus of official “Muslim language” texts commissioned during the Qing was written, including the inscription of the mosque that the Qianlong emperor had built in Beijing in 1764 (with Turkic alongside Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese), along with the “Muslim” sections of Qing dictionaries and linguistic handbooks.

    There is little evidence for the nature of outgoing correspondence, though it seems likely that the reverse procedure applied: official missives would be issued exclusively in Turkic, with local officials commissioning translations into Persian (if they were translated at all) before sending them on. Although multilingual imperial decrees in Manchu, Mongolian, and Turkic have survived, nothing of comparable significance was ever written in Persian. Not surprisingly, therefore, it seems that neighboring polities equipped to communicate in Turkic came to realize that this was the best medium for dealing with Kashgar and Yarkand. While the Khoqand court did occasionally dispatch letters to Xinjiang in Persian, it tended to write to Qing officials in Turkic. 15 Bukhara, as far as we can tell from limited records, also wrote to the Qing in Turkic.

    In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Mahmud Churas penned two works, the hagiographic Anis al-Talibin, and a continuation of Tarikh-i Rashidi, known to scholarship simply as the “chronicle” of Mahmud Churas. 21 Following Churas, the eighteenth century saw a series of hagiographies in the Naqshbandiyya-Afaqiyya tradition, leaving little doubt that the language was best kept up in Sufi circles: Mir Khal al-Din Yarkandi’s Hidayat-nama, Shams al-Din Ibn ‘Ali’s Siyar al-Mukhlisin, Kafshin Khoja’s Jami‘ al-Asrar and ‘Iqd al-Gawhar, and anonymous works such as Tazkirat al-Hidayat. 22 Although best known for their Turkic compositions, eighteenth-century authors Zalili and Khoja Jahan ʿArshi also wrote mystical poetry in Persian. 23 There were certainly more such texts in the eighteenth century than in the seventeenth, permitting the hypothesis that the dominance of the Naqshbandiyya following the fall of the Chaghataiids gave the Persian language a temporary boost in the Tarim Basin. Following this, there was no local writing in Persian for around a century, until the anti-Qing uprising of the 1860s. Among the flurry of historical writing that these events inspired were two masnawi poems in Persian describing the rebellion in Kucha and praising its leader Khwaja Rashid al-Din.

Nakanishi credits Chang’s work with reviving the study of Persian to some extent, at least in northeast China. The accounts of early twentieth-century Hui intellectuals would seem to support this view. These identified the madrasas of Shandong, Beijing-Tianjin, and Manchuria as giving equal emphasis to Persian and Arabic texts, while the so-called Shaanxi school taught a curriculum that was almost exclusively Arabic.

    Among Turkic translations of Persian in Xinjiang, the difficulty of the Persian text is typically given as the primary reason for the translation. This, for example, is from the preface to a Turkic translation of a hagiography of the Sufi saint of Samarqand, Makhdum-i A‘zam: “Since some Turk devotees were worried that they couldn’t grasp its meaning, they requested from me that I translate this important treatise into Turkic, so that it would be easy to understand, and that readers and listeners would obtain the full benefit of its blessings.” 34 By this time, though, such introductions were highly formulaic: the patron requests that a text to be translated into Turkic, the translator wrestles with his conscience for a while and then commits to the task. A nineteenth-century translation of Tazkira-i Bughrakhan begins in this way: One day there was a private party in which many learned men were honored. Stories were told from all sides—not just stories but traditions. Finally, Tazkira-i Bughrakhan was read, and we were greatly enlivened by it. But because it was composed in Persian, many could not comprehend its meaning. I served as translator for the gathering, or indeed as reciter. As I explained the meaning, I clarified it for those who had not understood. Then the amir declared to me: “You should translate this and gain merit! It was written in Persian, you should get to work on a Turkic version. [The book] has been very beneficial for Persian speakers, let the Turkic speakers enjoy it too!” With the amir making such a request, there was no way that I could refuse.

    It seems that most translations had only limited distribution, and whether or not a translation of a text existed, the ideal was still to read it in the original Arabic or Persian. Take, for example, Najm al-Din Razi’s Mirsad al-‘ Ibad, a popular thirteenth-century Persian instructional work on Sufism, which was rendered into both Chinese and Turkic versions during the Qing. In 1651, Wu Zunqi (or Zixian) translated it into Chinese as Guizhen yaodao (The Essentials of Returning to the Truth), but forbade its printing, and his translation did not circulate widely until the end of the Qing. 37 In Xinjiang, one Muhammad Rahim Kashghari translated the text into Turkic in Aqsu in the 1760s, known from a lone copy in Ürümchi.

    In Xinjiang, primary schools would provide a limited introduction to Persian classics such as Sa‘di’s Gulistan, while reading ability in Persian could be obtained in a madrasa, though possibly only in a few locations in the province. In the 1890s, a Tatar visitor to the town of Astana in the Turfan oasis found a teacher (mudarris) who had great expertise in Persian. Chief among the texts that he imparted to his pupils was Maktubat by the great Naqshbandi Sufi ‘renewer’ Ahmad Sirhindi (1564–1624), no doubt among the most widely read and recited Persian texts in late Qing Xinjiang. 40 Apart from this, a madrasa education might have included Persian literary and hagiographic works such as Rumi’s Masnawi, the diwan of Hafiz, and Jami’s Nafahat al-Uns. Martin Hartmann offers an interesting observation from his visit to Kashgar in 1902, that Persian literature and poetry was studied in the hot summer months, while the more difficult fields of jurisprudence and grammar were tackled during the winter, primarily on the basis of Arabic texts.

    For this stratum at least, the fact that Turkic had become the default “Muslim language” of the Qing would equally have enhanced its suitability as a literary medium. Patronage of translation, then, represented an effort to maintain a semblance of courtly culture in Qing Xinjiang, while mediating between Qing officialdom and local society. This involved drawing on texts such as those narrating local royal traditions (the Bughra Khan cycle), the mirror of princes genre (e.g., Qabus-nama), as well as more accessible historical and hagiographic vignettes from the Islamic tradition (such as Nawbahari’s Durr al-Majalis, Kashifi’s Rawzat al-Shuhada, and Qisas al-Ghara’ib, a compendium of translations).

    This literary activity during the Qing breathed new life into works that seem to have been poorly known in Xinjiang by the eighteenth century. To give one example, while hardly any Persian copies of Mirza Haydar’s Tarikh-i Rashidi have come to light in Xinjiang, several Turkic translations received wide circulation. While serving as hakim beg of Yarkand in 1805–11, Yunus ibn Iskandar commissioned Muhammad Sadiq Kashghari to produce one such translation. Kashghari’s preface depicts Yunus as conscious of the significance of Tarikh-i Rashidi as a repository of local traditions of royal authority. Outlining his instructions to the translator, he says: The rise of Chinggis Khan, the end of the ‘Abbasid caliphs, Sultan Muhammad Khwarazmshah’s martyrdom, and his conquest of the world—all of these events are recorded in detail in Zafar-nama and Timur-nama, which were incorporated into Tarikh-i Rashidi. The events beginning with Tughluq Temür Khan down to ‘Abd al-Rashid Khan are recounted in Tarikh-i Rashidi, along with an account of what rights these Moghul khans had in this region, which khan exercised justice and was praised for it and came to a good end, and which acted cruelly and fell into ruin and destruction. But this book was composed in Persian, with delicate expressions and subtle wording, and much obscure vocabulary. It relies on allusions and similes, and is full of rhyming prose. Because of this, the historical narratives in this book were hidden from the people of Mughulistan like a veiled virgin. Thus it is necessary for you to render this into the Turkic speech that is current in Kashgar, so that the common people can understand it and gain insight into its secrets. 45 In associating himself with Tarikh-i Rashidi, Yunus was not simply advertising his interest in models of good governance. The translation can be read as part of a deliberate policy to link his Turfani family (of obscure origins) to the Chaghataiid heritage of Yarkand. During his tenure there, Yunus also funded the restoration of one of ‘Abd al-Rashid Khan’s constructions—the shrine of Muhammad Sharif, a Sufi shaykh prominent at the court in the sixteenth century. The long Persian inscription in the rebuilt shrine’s interior, a text linking Yunus to Muhammad Sharif’s deputy Mir Wali Sufi, is a rare exception to the preference for Turkic among the begs.

    From the viewpoint of the court, the “Muslim language” of the empire was Turkic, not Persian or Arabic. From the second half of the eighteenth century onward, Turkic served as Xinjiang’s interface with the cosmopolitan linguistic culture of the high Qing. For Qing officials, Persian was the language of a set of relatively insignificant tributary polities to the west of Xinjiang. Although the Manchus inherited translation capacity in Persian from the Ming, it was never utilized, and Persian correspondence was filtered at the frontier. The court had little to no knowledge of Iran as a distinct political actor, nor did it have direct diplomatic contact with Mughal India, and it therefore saw no need to enhance its ability to communicate with the outside world in Persian.

    diplomacy. In Xinjiang, there have been various efforts to revive the study of Persian, which is an important accompaniment to the study of the Chaghatai Turkic tradition, but even at Xinjiang University it has never become an established part of the curriculum. This may in part be due to the political sensitivities that surround Islamic studies in Xinjiang, though it can equally be seen as a product of the modernist and nationalist critiques of Persian that Turkic-speaking intellectuals participated in from the late nineteenth-century on.

    Abdulladzhan Muginov’s classic Opisanie uigurskikh rukopisei Instituta Narodov Azii (Description of the Uyghur Manuscripts of the Institute of the Peoples of Asia), published in Moscow in 1962, does not help us much in this comparative endeavor, being focused only on Turkic material. 3 Chronologically, the first of the three catalogues under scrutiny here is the manuscript collection of Jules-Léon Dutreuil de Rhins and Fernand Grenard, which remains understudied, because its documents are scattered in different places in Paris and its catalogue—or rather the notes written during the expedition—is unpublished and not always accurate. Although the explorer and the orientalist were clearly more interested in Turkic books, they also collected a few Persian items during their tribulations in southern Xinjiang, which started in 1891 and ended brutally in June 1894 with the murder of Dutreuil de Rhins by Tibetan highwaymen in Qinghai. Among the fifty manuscripts they sent from China to France, there are only two in Persian (a diwan by Hafiz, copied in 1731, and, translated from the Arabic, Qazwini’s medieval cosmography, ‘Aja’ib al-Makhluqat, dated 1861), and two Chaghatai translations from Persian (a Sufi treatise of the late eighteenth century and a book on ethics copied in the first half of the nineteenth century). Persian manuscripts thus make up only 10 percent of the total, a figure that we will encounter again, although this is too small a selection to be representative.

    The second catalogue under scrutiny is that based on the expedition of the German orientalist Martin Hartmann, who visited Eastern Turkistan in 1902–3 and came back with 133 manuscripts, all of which are now preserved in Berlin’s Staatsbibliothek. In his catalogue, Hartmann did not provide dates, nor did he consistently identify the language of the books. 4 Yet it is possible to make a general evaluation based on the titles. For instance, we can safely assume that all professional manuals (simply called risala) (numbers 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 26, 27, 84, 87, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94); Mir ‘Ali Shir Nawa’i’s masnawis (numbers 15, 16, 68); Kharabati’s masnawi (numbers 22, 29); and even the recent hagiographies (tazkiras) (numbers 6, 14, 66, 122) are all composed in Chaghatai. Hartmann lists only eight documents as being in Persian or including substantial Persian text (numbers 8, 28, 74, 75, 97, 102, 111, 131), but other books in the collection are certainly written in that language, such as ‘Abdullah Ansari’s works (numbers 28, 32) and Fayzullah’s Rahat al-Qulub (numbers 55, 62, 73). This means that there are at least thirteen Persian manuscripts in the Hartmann collection, again 10 percent of the total.

    Far richer, the third collection is that of the Swedish ambassador and Turkologist Gunnar Jarring, which is preserved in the University Library of Lund, Sweden. The collection was first established by Swedish missionaries, such as Gustaf Raquette, who stayed in the Kashgar region from 1896 to 1921, and then expanded by Jarring himself during the 1930s. It now contains about 575 manuscripts, of which only a small proportion do not originate in Xinjiang. 5 With sixty-nine texts either fully in Persian or including significant Persian parts, we have again 10 percent of the total.

    In the first period, from the sixteenth to eighteenth century, there are either practical documents, such as a marriage formula (Prov. 264) and a commentary on jurisprudence (fiqh) (Prov. 40), or quite sophisticated works such as the monumental philosophical poem of Nizami, Makhzan al-Asrar (Prov. 308), Jamal Husayni’s Rawzat al-Ahbab (Prov. 244, a Timurid biography of the Prophet, the People of the House, and the Companions), and Abu Nasr Farahi’s Nisab al-Sibyan (Prov. 350, a metrical Arabic-Persian glossary of the thirteenth century). As for the second historical period, from the early nineteenth century to the 1870s, while there are Sufi hagiographical dictionaries such as Lari’s Takmil-i Nafahat al-Uns (Prov. 168, a commentary on Jami’s famous fifteenth-century Nafahat al-Uns) and Badr al-Din Ishaq’s Asrar al-Awliya (Prov. 66, an Indian compendium), we also find many didactic treatises on religious duties and ethics, among which the most worthy of mention are Sufi Allahyar’s Maslak al-Muttaqin (Prov. 231 and Prov. 419, a classic on religious duties written in the spirit of Sufi beliefs), Rahat al-Qulub (Prov. 267), and a few other more obscure works (Prov. 192, Prov. 291). 7 Prov. 512 contains Arabic-Persian lexicons, and at least four manuscripts copied in Persian, but often including Arabic and Chaghatai segments, deal with devotion and magic (Prov. 75, Prov. 401 and Prov. 503 on prayers and amulets, and Prov. 193 on geomancy).

    The third time period, from the 1880s to the early twentieth century, confirms this tendency toward less complexity and more ritualism. Linguistic material now includes Chaghatai and is reduced to short vade mecum (Prov. 306, Prov. 360, and Prov. 377). Sufi writings meanwhile are now limited to a few brief hagiographies (tazkiras) (Prov. 73, Prov. 307). Most of the manuscripts are devotional literature: books about or of prayers, mixing Arabic, Persian, and Chaghatai (Prov. 70, Prov. 71, Prov. 416, Prov. 157 and Prov. 505, both being Muhammad ibn Ahmad Zahid’s Targhib al-Salat); prayers with amulets (Prov. 393); prayers with magic (Prov. 425); and a talismanic scroll (Prov. 452).

    In sum, during the early modern period, the elite of Eastern Turkistan mastered Persian. This is confirmed by the fact that the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw also a relatively important movement promoting Persian writings in the joint intellectual fields of historiography and hagiography, respectively patronized by the region’s Chaghataiid sultans and Khwaja Sufi rulers. This is not the place to revisit a literary history that has partly been written, so it is sufficient to mention the following major works: Mirza Haydar Dughlat’s Tarikh-i Rashidi (composed outside the Tarim Basin but by a Kashgari ruler of Kashmir); Mahmud Churas’s Tarikh (a follow-up to Dughlat’s historical work); the Anis al-Talibin by the same author; Mir Khal al-Din al-Yarkandi’s Hidayat-nama; the anonymous hagiographical Tazkira-yi Afaq Khwaja (also known as Tazkirat al-Hidayat); and the Sufi oral commentaries on Rumi’s Masnawi-yi Ma‘nawi undertaken by experts known as masnawi-khwan (masnawi-reciters). 8 We may finally speculate that excerpts of Persian texts were quoted orally in sermons and preaching, as a recent if erratic survey of manuscript collections in Xinjiang suggests. Mozafar Bakhtyar found no fewer than three intriguing items comprising sermons in Persian: in Bishkiram, in the collection of the imam’s Friday mosque, a text called Firdaws al-Wa‘izin; in Yengisar’s Friday mosque, a Majmu‘a-yi Khutbaha-yi Farsi Dawazdamahi, and in Poskam, the Khutba-nama-yi Dawazdamahi.

This is why the knowledgeable and powerful Khwaja (Khush) Kifek Bek . . . asked me, the miserable one, to translate this work into Turki and continually to simplify [asan] its meaning for general readership [khass-u-‘ am].”

    This translation process seems to have lasted until the mid-nineteenth century, as attested by the Jarring collection. Thus Prov. 334, copied in the late eighteenth century, is the Chaghatai version of Shahr-i Gulshan, a didactic religious treatise, which could correspond to Lahiji’s Sharh-i Gulshan-i Raz, composed in the fifteenth century. Prov. 261, copied in 1841–42, is the Chaghatai version of the anonymous Tazkirat al-Anbiya. Prov. 341, copied around 1856–57, is a Chaghatai version of Fayzullah’s Rahat al-Qulub. These are in addition to the two translations mentioned in the catalogue of the Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard collection. Apparently, this translation process ceased abruptly with the emirate of Ya‘qub Beg between 1864 and 1877, although these books still circulated in Khotan after 1863, according to Fernand Grenard.

    Among upper-class religious authorities—composed of muezzins, imams, qadis (Muslim judges), muftis, and the ‘ulama—only the latter could be considered highly educated. 15 In most serious madrasas, students learned the Quran by heart, studied some jurisprudence (fiqh) and listened to commentaries on the Persian classics such as Sa‘di’s Gulistan. In more precise linguistic terms, Chinese learning was very uncommon, and qadis and muftis did not master Arabic and Persian. In fact for most of them, Chaghatai (known as Turki) was so much in use in the region that it was called the “Muslim tongue” (musulman tili).

    Vertical scrolls have existed in Eastern Turkistan since the medieval period. But it seems that their economic and juridical usages have been abandoned in modern times, though the format was still very much in use in western Turkistan until the early twentieth century, especially for endowment deeds (waqf-nama), genealogical charts (shajara), or other secular and religious decrees and acts, such as yarliq (royal commands), wasiqa (endowments), fatwas, and so on.

    Grenard and Dutreuil de Rhins also collected two comparable scrolls in the course of their expedition. Called asnad-i du‘a (or asna-du‘a), which means “prayer document,” they both measure 170 × 9 centimeters and are written in Chaghatai with Arabic prayers and some Persian specific vocabulary. They both date from the late nineteenth century. The first talisman targets the demon Ibn Sabyan and stipulates that anyone who keeps the paper talisman with him will be under God’s protection against djinns, evil spirits (diw), male demon (albasti), and other evils. Women especially must keep the talisman with them every day. This is explained by the following story. During a battle, King Solomon encountered a giant and asked him who he was. The giant said his name was Ibn Sabyan and explained that he penetrated the bodies of pregnant women to kill their fetuses. On hearing this, Solomon composed a prayer so as to struggle against Ibn Sabyan’s devilry. We can therefore understand that the talisman was made to protect women during pregnancy. Concerning its language precisely, beside the reference to Solomon, famously known in the Persian tradition as the one who masters the secret ‘language of birds’ (mantiq al-tayr, taken from Quran 27: 15), we find a series of terms holding negative, even nihilistic, values, which were quite unusual in Chaghatai and here served an apotropaic function. These terms were ziyandash (noxious), zakhm (trauma), gunahkar (sinner), and nabud (annihilated). In the same way that amulets represent wild beasts, or parents give children apotropaic names (the name of a physical or moral defect, for example), in explicitly naming calamities the talisman resorted to Persian words to ward off evil powers.

<div class="noteText">
    The second talismanic scroll is dedicated to Kithmir, the dog of the Companions of the Cave (ashab al-kahf, from Quran 18: 7–26). The text does not provide any explanation about this attribution. Like the first talisman, it is said that anyone who keeps the document with him will be under God’s protection against evil forces. The bearer will likewise be cherished in both worlds, and protected against afflictions, the devil’s oppression, the wrath of kings, false accusations, and all manner of other calamities. The second half of the scroll is more precise and focuses on love affairs. If someone was in love with someone else, the scribe would read this amulet and blow on either an apple, candy, or anything sweet and edible, and then the lover would give it to the beloved, rendering the latter madly in love with him or her. If a husband did not behave correctly with his wife, the scribe would write this amulet, and she would then keep it with her: the couple would live thereafter in happy tenderness. If a woman wants to bind (öru bol) someone, she would blow three times to the left of the beloved and he would become mad with love for her. For a man, the procedure would be that he blows three times to her right. As regards the uses of Persian what is interesting in this second section, and in the invocation at the end of the scroll, is the rich lexis of love and pain (quite common in Chaghatai), which comes from Persian elegiac poetry. It includes syntagmas like dard-i firaq (pain of separation), diwana-yi shayda (love madness), khun-i jigar (deep affliction), ‘ashiq-i biqarar (passionate lover), khar khar (anxious desire) and so on. Clearly, the language of love is Persian, which here serves the purpose of reification. Inspired by the technique of elegiac poetry, objectifying its heroes, the talisman makes a diverse and comprehensive use of the poetic vocabulary of passion to arouse that same passion and make it a reality rather than a literary fiction.

<div class="noteText">
    The third item in this talismanic corpus deals also with love stories, using the same idioms in a different way. Preserved in the Jarring collection in Lund (Prov. 14), the scroll measures 110 × 12 centimeters and can probably be dated to the early twentieth century. The text is in Arabic and late Chaghatai/ early Uyghur, mixed with Persian. 25 Explicitly called a talisman (tumar), the scroll is made for both men and women and should be kept on one’s person in order to be effective. Its aim is to awaken love and unite couples, either by drawing a lover to their beloved or by maintaining long-term relationships. In the latter case, it is stipulated that the lover must carry the talisman on a Thursday and whisper to the right of the beloved three times, “By order of God.” Other magical techniques are also described. Then, in the final invocation (which mentions God, Adam and Eve, the archangels, Muhammad and Fatima), reference is made to the legendary literary couples Layla and Majnun and Yusuf and Zulaykha, who thus appear less as inaccessible mystical allegories than as embodiments of the vicissitudes of ordinary emotional life. Here again, the talisman maker had recourse to the Persian elegiac tradition. At the linguistic level, the text on the talisman mainly repeated the expression “passionate lover” (‘ ashiq-i biqarar), used in lines 9, 11, 17, 35, and 50, which characterizes the overall usage of Persian in that scroll. By recurrence and anaphora rather than by the literary synonymization of the preceding case, this locution assumes a performative function similar to the more usual ritualistic iterations of Islamic talismanic scrolls. It is this repetition of specific phrases, whether Quranic or not, that empowers the efficacy of the written talisman.
