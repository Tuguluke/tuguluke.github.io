    Marshallian economics was based on a commonsense understanding of the subject and how business worked in practice, emanating from the mercantilist tradition that had made Britain the most successful commercial nation in history.

    The Austrian School was particularly concerned with prices, in particular the “opportunity cost” of a product, that is, the alternatives that consumers choose between when buying competing goods. If a person buys a beer, he does so instead of buying wine; if a person invests money, she forgoes interest; if a person sells investments, he forgoes the price the investment may achieve later.

    Hayek recalled. The “little discovery” that Keynes had “anticipated” was that by fixing a currency’s price to gold—“ the gold standard”—domestic prices would fluctuate and could not be controlled. Governments were faced with a choice: to have a fixed-price currency or fixed domestic prices. As Keynes put it, “If the external price level is unstable, we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose.”

    Keynes concluded that “in the long run” there must be a constant relationship between the quantity of money in a system and stable prices. However, “this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs,” 39 he argued, as what changed prices in relation to the quantity of money over time was the speed with which money is spent (the “velocity of circulation”), which could alter prices out of proportion to the quantity of money. While equilibrium depended on “the long run,” he averred, in what was to become one of his most famous remarks, that “in the long run we are all dead.”

    As Hayek put it, “Socialism promised to fulfill our hopes for a more rational, more just world. And then came [Mises’s Socialism]. Our hopes were dashed. Socialism told us that we had been looking for improvement in the wrong direction.” 1 Mises’s principal objection to a communist or socialist society was that it ignored the price mechanism he believed essential for any economy to operate efficiently.

    Mises’s arguments went to the core of the debate that was to ensue between Keynes and Hayek, and they presaged one of Hayek’s eventual contentions, that by ignoring market prices socialism deprives individuals of their unique contribution to society—to express, through their willingness to pay a price, their opinion of the worth of an object or service. Central planning, Hayek would argue, deprives individuals of a fundamental freedom.

    He credited what he called “the Economists” for settling the competing arguments between “conservative individualists,” such as John Locke, 11 David Hume, 12 and Edmund Burke, 13 and the “democratic egalitarians,” Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 14 William Paley, 15 and Jeremy Bentham, 16 by contending that “by the working of natural laws individuals pursuing their own interests with enlightenment in conditions of freedom always tend to promote the general interest.” 17 Or, put briefly, the public good was the sum of the individual self-interests of all individuals combined.

    When the amount invested was larger than the amount saved, the result was a boom accompanied by price inflation. Conversely, when savings ran ahead of investment, a state of depression occurred, accompanied by deflation and unemployment. He reasoned that total income in an economy stemmed from the sale of both consumer goods and capital goods. If there were no savings and total income was instead spent on consumer goods, the price of those goods would sharply rise and there would be a boom. Conversely, if all income were saved, the price of consumer goods would fall and industries would fail.

    So I got up and asked, ‘Is it your view that if I went out tomorrow and bought a new overcoat, that would increase unemployment?’ ‘Yes,’ said Hayek. ‘But,’ pointing to his triangles on the board, ‘it would take a very long mathematical argument to explain why.’” 23

    Cantillon, and later the Scots philosopher David Hume, observed that over time the general effect of the new supply of money helped only those who discovered and produced it, and that the rest of society ended up suffering as the new supplies of silver and gold raised prices. Although he considered it useful, Hayek said he had reservations about Cantillon’s theory as “the effects may be quite opposite depending upon when the additional money comes first into the hands of traders and manufacturers.”

    He believed he was on the verge of a breakthrough in the theory of money that would “no longer [be] a theory of the value of money in general, but a theory of the influence of money on the different ratios of exchange between goods of all kinds.” 40 Hayek then made a startling declaration: money has no intrinsic value. “There is . . . no need for money in this sense—the absolute amount of money in existence is of no consequence to the well-being of mankind—and there is, therefore, no objective value of money in the sense in which we speak of the objective value of goods. What we are interested in is only how the relative values of goods as sources

    how did methods of production needing less capital progress to methods needing more capital? The answer was simple: when people spent less on consumer goods and saved more, their savings were invested in capital goods. But there was another way: more capital goods might be produced when money was made available to producers by bank loans. This second method, he said, was not real saving but “forced saving” because the new investment had come about not because of an increase in savings but simply because it suited banks to lend. When the money lent to producers was reduced to its former level, the capital invested in equipment was lost.

    “The only way permanently to ‘mobilize’ all available resources is, therefore, not to use artificial stimulants—whether during a crisis or thereafter—but to leave it to time to effect a permanent cure.” 46 In brief, there was no easy way out of a slump.

    Hayek suggested that the amount of money in an economy, and the speed with which it passed from one to another, held the key to understanding how the system worked. “Under the existing conditions, money will always exert a determining influence on the course of economic events and . . . therefore, no analysis of actual economic phenomena is complete if the role played by money is neglected,” he declared.

    In Prices and Production, Hayek had sought to prove that if money is lent at a rate that is out of step with the sum of savings, it is invested in production that cannot sustain itself. When further funding dries up, factory owners find they do not attract customers and some lines of production are brought to an abrupt halt. In other words, when the price of borrowing money is out of kilter, it corrupts the ordered stages of production of goods until, after a period of crisis, the economy finds a new equilibrium.

    The incremental spending on wages rather than capital would, he suggested, over time slow up the growth in producers’ goods and a new equilibrium would be reached where interest rates would be “the same rate as before the forced saving took place, and [producers’] capital worn down to something approaching its former state.”

    Hayek was convinced that the economy as a whole was an elusive subject that could only be understood, and even then only partially, by considering the interaction of individuals in the marketplace. Keynes, however, was in the process of making a breakthrough in thinking that would emerge only on publication of The General Theory. He believed an economy could best be understood by grasping the big picture, looking from the top down at aggregates of such elements of the economy as supply, demand, and interest rates. Hayek was stuck in what came to be known as “microeconomic” thinking, looking at the different elements such as costs and value that made up an economy, while Keynes was making

    Hayek was aware that his contribution to the debate with Keynes was little more than repeating the pessimistic logic inherent in Austrian School thinking. As he was later to confess, “What I had done had often seemed to me more to point out barriers to further advance on the path chosen by others than to supply new ideas which opened the path to further development.”

    The Circus certainly left its mark. Members were instrumental in persuading Keynes that he was in error in A Treatise when he invoked “the widow’s cruse,” a typically colorful Keynesian analogy that suggested that when entrepreneurs spent part of their profit on buying goods, they raised prices to a similar degree, thereby restoring their profits to their former level and leaving them as rich as before, much like the pitcher of oil in the biblical story of the “widow’s cruse” (1 Kings 17: 8-16) that remained full however much the widow poured from it. By the same token, they disabused him of his fondness for the obverse notion to the widow’s cruse, which he termed “the Danaid jar,” after the Greek myth that told of the daughters of Danaus in the Underworld who were sentenced to perpetually replenish a leaky jar. Keynes’s Danaid jar theory suggested that when entrepreneurs sought to curtail their losses by cutting their consumption and increasing savings, the law of diminishing returns meant they could never recover their former wealth. 12 Both Kahn and Joan Robinson drew Keynes’s attention to his error in thinking that, in describing the closed economy necessary to establish his conclusions, he deemed the output of consumption goods to be fixed and finite. Kahn exposed the fallacy thus: “If entrepreneurs responded to the abnormal profits by increasing the output of consumption goods, the price level of consumption goods would progressively fall, and abnormal profits would fall, until either entrepreneurs earned no more than normal remuneration or some barrier was encountered—full capacity utilisation or full employment of labour.”

    If an equilibrium was invariably elusive in the real world, Hayek argued, then the a priori assumptions that theoretical economists make about the operation of an economy, or a market, tending toward an equilibrium would always fall short. An equilibrium can be predicted only if the intentions of each of the participants is known, and that is impossible both in theory and in practice. This may seem a slight point, as he readily admitted, but by denying the existence of a predictable equilibrium and denying the validity of a priori assumptions about the many accurate and inaccurate human choices that make up even the simplest decisions in a market, Hayek broke new ground.

    which each individual possesses perfect knowledge of both existing and future conditions needed to make a decision in a perfect market. But, Hayek reminded his audience, the perfect market does not exist. Economic decisions in real life are made by individuals based on partial knowledge of current conditions coupled with their best guess of what may happen. Each individual comes to a different (and often contrary) judgment about what those conditions might be. Some get the decisions right, some wrong. But together their decisions combine to form a moving picture of the market in operation.

If a totalitarian ruler, or even apparently benign apolitical “planners,” were to interfere in the economy on the assumption that they knew best or thought they knew the minds of others, they would inevitably frustrate the wishes and curtail the happiness and liberties of the individuals in whose interest they claimed to act.

    Hayek had introduced a new notion, the division of knowledge, that he believed was as important as the economic notion of the division of labor, the stage of industrial development where instead of individuals making a whole product, workers specialize in single tasks that together make a whole product. He maintained that it was impossible to understand or measure the full weight of the countless individual economic decisions made by the vast number of individuals that made up an economy, but that their intentions were reflected in ever-fluctuating prices. The price of an object was the point at which at least two individuals agreed. Because prices are essentially organic, like the people whose combined will contributes to their determination, any attempt to alter or interfere with prices was ultimately futile, for human behavior will always circumvent the presumptions on which a price is fixed. By the same token, price inflation, whether deliberately or unintentionally stoked by government action, was a means whereby those in command of an economy could flout the wishes of those obliged to pay the price, thereby denying their citizens’ will.

    By denying the operation of the free market, Keynes had redefined scarcity as an “artificial” state of affairs “created by the determination of people not to sell their services and products below certain arbitrarily fixed prices.” Keynes had ignored market prices and suggested that they came into play only “at rare intervals when ‘full employment’ is approached and the different goods begin successively to become scarce and to rise in price.”

    “There is little ground for believing that a system with the modern complex credit structure will ever work smoothly without some deliberate control of the monetary mechanism,” Hayek wrote, “since money by its very nature constitutes a kind of loose joint in the self-equilibrating apparatus of the price mechanism which is bound to impede its working. The aim of any successful monetary policy must be to reduce as far as possible this slack in the self-correcting forces of the price mechanism, and to make adaptation more prompt so as to reduce the necessity for a later, more violent, reaction.” 42 But, in a warning to those like Friedman who would come to resort to quantitative monetary theory as a cure-all, Hayek suggested there were strict limits to this means of managing the economy.

Robbins, in his English understated way, described this explanation as “misleading” and described Hayek’s remedy for the Depression—letting the market find its own level by writing down mistaken investments and raising interest rates to encourage more saving and to deter consumer spending—“ as unsuitable as denying blankets and stimulants to a drunk who has fallen into an icy pond, on the ground that his original trouble was overheating.”

Then the paradox of depression and unemployment in the midst of inflation would be experienced.” 21 It would take thirty years before Harberler was proved right.

    Looking again at the data of the Great Depression, he reasoned that had the Federal Reserve between 1929 and 1933 increased the supply of money by lowering interest rates rather than sharply contracted it, the slump would have lasted only a couple of years. The Great Depression was, therefore, by Friedman’s reckoning, the “Great Contraction,” a manmade disaster that might have been avoided. To ameliorate the business cycle, Friedman suggested keeping a tight rein on monetary growth, only allowing the supply of money to grow slowly, a policy that became known as “monetarism.”

Hayek had attempted to show that such a policy directed labor into industries that failed as soon as the stimulus was withdrawn. Friedman approached Keynes from another direction: an economy deep in recession did not so much need more demand than an adequate, but not too generous, supply of money. Setting the right level of money would result in a “natural level of employment,” which may or may not be full employment, while too much or too little money in the system would cause unemployment and/ or inflation.

I wasn’t going to go to work for six cents on the dollar.” 19 When the fashion in Hollywood leading men switched after World War II from the clean-cut, soft-hearted type like Reagan to hard-bitten heroes like William Holden, Reagan found he was no longer in demand, yet he owed an enormous tax bill from the years he had been earning big money.

    The “Laffer curve” instantly became the hastily drawn device used by economists around Reagan to convince others that tax cuts would boost revenues. Sharply cutting income taxes, the Reaganites argued, would increase personal spending, which would in turn increase demand through a “trickle-down” effect on the whole economy. A third key element to Reaganomics, also promoted by Laffer, was “supply-side economics,” the notion that a booming economy could best be achieved by encouraging producers to supply more and cheaper goods by cutting industry regulations and corporate taxes rather than relying on “demand-led” growth spurred by Keynesian public spending. Laffer was graceful enough to point out that, despite his name being attached to it, the Laffer curve was not his invention and that others, notably Keynes, had beaten him to the punch. “Nor should the argument seem strange that taxation may be so high as to defeat its object,” Keynes had written in 1933, “and that, given sufficient time to gather the fruits, a reduction of taxation will run a better chance than an increase of balancing the budget.”

    Although there was general agreement among stewards of the national economy that a Keynes and Friedman cocktail should be employed to maximize economic growth and choke off inflation, there remained a profound difference between academic economists, who from the 1970s onward were divided roughly along the lines of the old Keynes-Hayek debate. On one side were the “freshwater economists,” so called because their universities clustered around the Great Lakes; on the other, the “saltwater economists” who hailed from schools on the coasts. Freshwater economists considered, like Hayek, inflation to be a country’s worst curse; saltwater economists thought, like Keynes, unemployment more serious. The freshwater group believed the economy should be thought of as a sentient organism ruled by the rational decisions of those who participate in the market. While government should ensure that a market was free and fair, government spending and taxation perverted the natural order of an economy. They assumed that individuals made rational decisions based on what they understood the future to hold; that businessmen held back from new investments when they feared that state spending to spur economic growth would lead to higher taxes and inflation; and that globalization and the rise of electronic communications led to more efficient markets that benefited all. Recessions, they claimed, were routine aspects of an economic cycle that must be endured, not cured. They preferred “supply-side” remedies that encouraged businesses to provide cheaper goods and thereby boost demand by removing government inhibitions such as regulations and business taxes. The saltwater tribe believed that an economy left to its own devices would not suit everyone. They considered recessions symptoms of an economy in poor health, or the result of unforeseen shocks, and sought to cure unemployment at the bottom of the business cycle. They believed markets, particularly in unionized labor, to be slow to respond to changes, and competition to be imperfect. They acknowledged the logic of supply-side reforms, but put more emphasis on “demand-pull” remedies that concentrated on putting more money into the system to make goods more affordable.

Bush did not think long about how to spend this rare legacy: he wanted to blow the whole of the surplus—and more—on cutting personal taxation.

    One key difference between the two men, whether an economy is best understood from the top down or the bottom up, through macroeconomics or microeconomics, left Keynes in the ascendant. His big-picture approach is universally used today, as are such concepts as gross domestic product, key tools by which economists measure an economy.

    Friedman, by his monetarist prescriptions, refined Keynes, but he did not replace him. “[ Monetarism] has benefited much from Keynes’s work,” he wrote in 1970. “If Keynes were alive today, he would no doubt be at the forefront of the [monetarist] counter-revolution.” 4 Keynes was looking for a cure for mass unemployment. His remedy was to increase total aggregate demand. He suggested a number of routes: through monetary means, by lowering interest rates and funneling new money into the economy; by tax breaks; and through public works. Friedman persuaded economists that when on an even keel, the economy would be served better by a gradual, moderate, predictable increase in the supply of money.

    was closer to Keynes and often praised Keynes’s economics, in particular A Tract on Monetary Reform. Hayek conceded that “Milton’s monetarism and Keynesianism have more in common with each other than I have with either.” 5 When it came to politics, however, Friedman was closer to Hayek. Keynes believed state intervention was a suitable means for improving the lives of citizens. Friedman agreed with Hayek that whenever the state intervened in the economy, it hampered the free market’s ability to create wealth. Friedman approved of cutting taxes, not to pump more money into the economy, as Keynes recommended, but because he believed that government would shrink as a result.

    Hayek took an absolutist position, that because no one could know what was in the minds of every member of society, and that the best indicator of their conflicting needs was market prices, all attempts to direct an economy were misplaced. Over time his failure to attract support during the Keynesian hegemony appeared to drive him into arguing his case ad absurdum. Eventually Hayek wanted state power to withdraw to a minimal citadel, and he wished to see every last element of the economy, even the issuance of money, in private hands because he challenged the state’s monopoly of money-creating powers. This put him in direct opposition to Friedman, who, while wishing for the government to be minimized, believed that an economy should be managed to provide steady growth. Friedman’s chosen instrument, monetary policy, required a state-run central bank. Hayek believed the issuance of money was the key to ending the business cycle that was the common concern of him and Keynes. “I believe that if it were not for government interference with the monetary system, we would have no industrial fluctuations and no periods of depression,” Hayek declared. “If you place the issue of money in the hands of firms whose business depends upon their success in keeping the money they issue stable, the situation changes completely.”

    Neither Thatcher nor Reagan made more than a start on achieving Hayek’s ultimate aim to replace the state with private enterprise. Of the two, Thatcher achieved the most, though she started from a lower base, having inherited a mixed economy that was ripe for reform. Reagan’s Hayekian rhetoric always outstripped his will to reduce the size of the state, as the ballooning of the federal budget during his presidency testifies.

    Hayek did not concede the point. He believed Sweden achieved economic success despite, not because of, its large state sector and that the ennui he sensed among Swedes was a symptom of their loss of freedom. “Sweden and Switzerland are the two countries which have escaped the damages [sic] of two wars and have become repositories of a large part of the capital of Europe,” he suggested. But such broadly shared prosperity and lack of unemployment came at a heavy price. “There is perhaps more social discontent [by which he perhaps meant suicides] in Sweden than in almost any other country I have been. The standard feeling that life is really not worth living is very strong in Sweden.”

    Hayek declared in 1949, “What we lack is a liberal Utopia, a program which seems neither a mere defence of things as they are nor a diluted kind of socialism, but a truly liberal radicalism. The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the socialist is that it was their courage to be Utopian which gained them the support of the intellectuals and thereby an influence on public opinion.”

    Among the services Hayek believed should be privatized were “all those from education to transport and communications, including post, telegraph, telephone and broadcasting services, all the so-called ‘public utilities,’ the various ‘social’ insurances and, above all, the issue of money.” 22 Tellingly, and perhaps surprisingly for those who subscribe to Hayek’s general aims today, he advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state, and he believed there should be free movement of labor across national borders.

    Instead he envisioned “quasi-commercial corporations competing for citizens.” 24 Those who did not like what the company offered should move elsewhere. He concluded that representative democracy too often provided a “tyranny of the majority” that reduced individual freedoms and imposed unnecessary costs.

    Generations of Americans had practiced Hayek’s philosophy long before he articulated it. Belief in the unbridled market was important to the eighteenth-century gentlemen who wrote the Constitution. Representative democracy, however, has over time encroached on absolute freedoms. As the conservative political scientist Adam Wolfson put it, citing Alexis de Tocqueville, “Big Government is, as it were, written into the political DNA of democracy.”

    The view of Austrian-American political philosopher Joseph Schumpeter that the free market must from time to time endure a period of “creative destruction” was not allowed to be put to the test. Having so markedly been proved wrong, the widely held assumption that the free market always righted itself over time was not given a second chance.

    Describing the battle in the 1930s between Keynes and Hayek, Nixon’s economic adviser Herbert Stein wrote in 1986, “Conventional conservatives have regarded Keynes as a dark and evil influence bent on undermining the free economic system. In fact, however, he helped to save the free system at a time when much more radical changes in it were being seriously advocated.” 28 Twenty-five years on, Stein’s words still rang true, but a growing number of Americans appeared more prepared to gamble that Hayek’s painful prescriptions were preferable to paying the price of Keynes’s remedies.

    “Keynes was exceedingly comfortable with the economic system he so brilliantly explored,” observed Galbraith. “So the broad thrust of his efforts, like that of Roosevelt, was conservative; it was to help ensure that the system would survive. But such conservatism in the English-speaking countries does not appeal to the truly committed conservative. . . . Better to accept the unemployment, idled plants, and mass despair of the Great Depression, with all the resulting damage to the reputation of the capitalist system, than to retreat on true principle. . . . When capitalism finally succumbs, it will be to the thunderous cheers of those who are celebrating their final victory over people like Keynes.”
