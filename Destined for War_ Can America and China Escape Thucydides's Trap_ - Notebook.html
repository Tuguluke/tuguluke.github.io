    when Kennedy elevated the alert level of the American nuclear arsenal to Defcon II, he made US weapons less vulnerable to a preemptive Soviet attack but simultaneously relaxed a score of safety catches. At Defcon II, German and Turkish pilots took their seats in NATO fighter bombers loaded with armed nuclear weapons less than two hours away from their targets in the Soviet Union. Since electronic locks on nuclear weapons had not yet been invented, there was no physical or technical barrier preventing a pilot from deciding to fly to Moscow, drop a nuclear bomb, and start World War III.

    The IMF had measured China’s GDP using the yardstick of purchasing power parity, or PPP, which is the standard now used by the major international institutions whose professional responsibilities require them to compare national economies.

    PPP truly is the best benchmark—and not just for assessing relative economic strength. “In comparing the size of national economies,” he told me, “especially for the purposes of assessing comparative military potential, as the first approximation, the best yardstick is PPP. This measures how many aircraft, missiles, ships, sailors, pilots, drones, bases, and other military-related items a state can buy and the prices it has to pay in its own national currency.”

    In Fairbank’s summary, classical Chinese foreign policy consisted of three key tenets: demand for regional “dominance,” insistence that neighboring countries recognize and respect China’s inherent “superiority,” and willingness to use this dominance and superiority to orchestrate “harmonious co-existence” with its neighbors.

    In Fairbank’s classic summary, “Chinese tended to think of their foreign relations as giving expression externally to the same principles of social and political order that were manifested internally.” As a result, “China’s foreign relations were accordingly hierarchic and non-egalitarian.” 11 Just as it suppressed dissent and demanded that all its citizens bow to the power of the central government, so too did it expect regional powers to prostrate themselves before Beijing.

    Finally, Fairbank taught that Chinese civilization was profoundly ethnocentric and culturally supremacist, seeing itself as the apex of all meaningful human activity. “The Chinese Emperor was conceived of and recognized as the pinnacle of a universal political hierarchy, with all other states’ rulers theoretically serving as vassals.” 12 In this system, as in the Confucian social system within China, order or harmony derived from hierarchy. The fundamental duty of states as well as individuals was Confucius’s commandment: “Know thy place.”

    Huntington identifies five key ways in which Western and Confucian societies tend to differ. First, as he notes, Confucian cultures reflect an ethos that reinforces “the values of authority, hierarchy, the subordination of individual rights and interests, the importance of consensus, the avoidance of confrontation, ‘saving face,’ and, in general, the supremacy of the state over society and of society over the individual.” He points out the contrasts between these attitudes and “American beliefs of liberty, equality, democracy, and individualism.” Furthermore, he underlines Americans’ “propensity to distrust the government, oppose authority, promote checks and balances, encourage competition, and sanctify human rights.” 16 Huntington also observes that the main Confucian culture, China, defines identity in racial terms: “Chinese are those of the same ‘race, blood, and culture.’” Putting the point provocatively, he notes that “for Chinese and those of Chinese descent living in non-Chinese societies, the ‘mirror test’ becomes the test of who they are: ‘go look in the mirror.’” This concept of Chinese culture is both incredibly narrow and enormously expansive, as it leads the Chinese government to believe that “people of Chinese descent, even if citizens of another country, are members of the Chinese community and hence in some measure subject to

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Clash of Civilizations > Page 138 · Location 2493

    the authority of the Chinese government.” 17 In line with that notion, Huntington argues that China’s view of external affairs is essentially an extension of its concept of internal order. Both reflect a Confucian emphasis on harmony through hierarchy—with China’s leader at the top. As Confucius said, just as “there are not two suns in the sky, there cannot be two emperors on earth.” 18 But while China projects its internal order outward, it has a nearly visceral mistrust of any external interference in its domestic affairs.

    think in fundamentally different time scales than Westerners. As he put it, they “tended to think of the evolution of their society in terms of centuries and millennia and to give priority to maximizing long-term gains.” Huntington contrasts this with “the primacy in American beliefs of forgetting the past, ignoring the future, and focusing on maximizing immediate gains.”

But what if direct engagement of armies risked national suicide? Under such conditions, alternatives had to be explored.

Had its junior partner, Communist China, become the vanguard of Communist expansion through “wars of liberation,” as most US policymakers viewed the Vietnam War, a Communist monolith could have overshadowed the US-led “free world.” Had the crisis of capitalism that was seen as the principal cause of the Great Depression of the 1930s persisted in the decades after World War II, Western European states could have succumbed to the attraction of socialism’s apparently inexorable march, on the one hand, and subversion by the KGB, on the other.

As he put it bluntly, “If it were to do so, it would collapse.” Second, comparing China to Germany and Japan misses the fact that the latter two were first defeated in a hot war, occupied by American troops, and governed for a period thereafter by American high commanders who even wrote their constitutions. In contrast, in Lee’s words, China will insist on “being accepted as China, not as an honorary member of the West.”

    Some 800,000 of China’s best and brightest go abroad for their education, 300,000 studying in the US. Pause to think about the fact that the current president of China and his wife sent their only child to college not at Xi’s alma matter of Tsinghua University, but rather at Harvard, where she graduated in 2014. How the views of an emerging generation of “internationalists” can be reconciled with the more nationalistic or populist inclinations of their fellow citizens is a puzzle. Finding ways in which the internationalists’ understanding of the world can be translated into new forms of cooperation remains among the most intriguing opportunities.

    Having taught at Harvard for five decades, I have seen thousands of bright students and professors come and go. Hundreds who seemed destined for greatness disappointed, yet hundreds more with fewer advantages soared. First impressions often fail, and trajectories take unanticipated twists and turns.

    While Xi and his Party mandarins no longer preach Marxist-Leninist doctrine, no one should be deluded into thinking that the regime today is a post-ideological movement concerned solely with its own power.

    On China, American policy essentially seeks to cling to the status quo: the Pax Americana established after World War II. Washington repeatedly, and accurately, reminds the Chinese that this has allowed the longest peace and largest increase in economic well-being Asian nations—and specifically China—have ever seen. But that status quo cannot be sustained when the underlying economic balance of power has tilted so dramatically in China’s favor. So America’s real strategy, truth be told, is hope.

    Make domestic challenges central. If Xi and Trump listened to Lee Kuan Yew, they would focus first on what matters most: their domestic problems. What is the single largest challenge to American national security today? What poses the single largest threat to America’s standing in the world? The answer to both questions is found in failures of the American political system. Ask the same questions of China and the answers are again the same: failures of governance. Honest observers in both societies are increasingly recognizing that neither “decadent” democracy nor “responsive” authoritarianism is fit for meeting the twenty-first century’s severest tests. I am a congenital optimist about America, but I worry that American democracy is exhibiting fatal symptoms. DC has become an acronym for Dysfunctional Capital: a swamp in which partisanship has grown poisonous, relations between the White House and Congress have paralyzed basic functions like budgets and foreign agreements, and public trust in government has all but disappeared. These symptoms are rooted in the decline of a public ethic, legalized and institutionalized corruption, a poorly educated and attention-deficit-driven electorate, and a

    At the same time, I share Lee’s devastating critique of China’s “operating system.” Technology is making its current system of governance obsolete. Young urbanites with smartphones cannot be sustainably governed by Beijing bureaucrats who track every citizen as part of an omnipresent “social credit” system. Lee identified an array of handicaps China will not easily change: the absence of the rule of law; excessive control from the center; cultural habits that limit imagination and creativity; a language “that shapes thinking through epigrams and 4,000 years of texts that suggest everything worth saying has already been said, and said better by earlier writers”; and an inability “to attract and assimilate talent from other societies in the world.”

    His prescription was not American-style democracy (which he thought would lead to China’s collapse), but a recovery of traditional mandarin virtues in a government with a strong leader. On that front, Xi’s value-centered nationalism may help restore integrity to a Chinese OS that has been hollowed out by rank materialism.

    In his book Civilization, Niall Ferguson identifies six “killer apps”—ideas and institutions that drove the extraordinary divergence in prosperity between the West and the rest of the world after 1500. These are competition, the scientific revolution, property rights, modern medicine, consumer society, and work ethic.

    As Winston Churchill observed, “Writing a book is an adventure. To begin with it is a toy and an amusement. Then it becomes a mistress, then it becomes a master, then it becomes a tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.”
