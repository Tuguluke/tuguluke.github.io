    world today would be incomplete without recognizing our enormous gains. The world is significantly wealthier, freer, healthier, and better educated than it was forty years ago. In 1980, over 40% of humanity lived in extreme poverty. Today, less than 10% does. In 1980, 44% of humanity had no democratic rights. Today, it is less than 25%. A child born in 1980 had a life expectancy of 63 years. A child born today should live a decade longer. In 1980, 30% of people fifteen years and older had no formal education. By 2015, that share had been cut in half. These were global gains, but America lay at the heart of them. U.S. innovation in everything

Assisting Humanity The postwar U.S. did not invest solely in its domestic recovery; it made multibillion-dollar investments in its weakened allies and fallen foes alike, including the $ 13.3 billion Marshall Plan. That tradition has continued: the U.S. remains the world’s largest provider of foreign aid (although it’s not the most generous on a share-of-GDP basis). Since 1980, the U.S. has extended roughly $ 1 trillion in nonmilitary aid, typically on a bipartisan basis. President Reagan directed over $ 1 billion in direct response to famine

But leaving the future up to private interests is shortsighted. First, private investments are subject to short-term market pressures, and as virtuous as the discipline of making your quarterly numbers can be, it’s too limiting for the long-term, uncharted inquiry of deep R& D. Second, because private investment means

These privileged shares are reserved exclusively for company insiders, giving them control over the company’s operations and insulating them from outside shareholder pressure. In December 2019, I took a small stake in Twitter and wrote a public letter to the board, highlighting the company’s lack of innovation and weak shareholder returns, and calling on them to replace part-time CEO Jack Dorsey.
