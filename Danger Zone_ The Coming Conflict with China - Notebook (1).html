<div class="noteText">
    The legacy of the One-Child policy was demographic disaster—an impending loss of nearly 200 million working-age individuals in China by mid-century. The regime had become more repressive as it grew ever more petrified of dissent. And in response to Chinese belligerence during the COVID-19 pandemic and for years thereafter, the democratic world had gradually been closing ranks to check Beijing’s rise. Taiwan was finally starting to shore up its inadequate military defenses, as its population rejected any suggestion of reunification with China. The United States—a country with a unique talent for slaying autocratic rivals—was waging a tech and tariff war against China’s economy while retooling its military to take on the PLA.

    Whereas Russia is essentially a two-dimensional great power that draws influence from its military and energy resources, China possesses a wider spectrum of coercive tools and can challenge the United States and its allies in almost any domain of geopolitical competition. Xi Jinping presides over the largest military and economy (measured by purchasing power parity) on the planet. Chinese officials occupy leadership positions in many of the world’s major international institutions. More than half of the world’s countries already trade more with China than with the United States;

    The stakes are hardly academic. “The history of failure in war,” General Douglas MacArthur explained in 1940, “can almost be summed up in two words: too late. Too late in comprehending the deadly purpose of a potential enemy; too late in preparedness; too late in uniting all possible forces for resistance; too late in standing with one’s friends.” It would be “the greatest strategical mistake in all history,” he added, if America failed to grasp “the vital moment.”

    1. The Chinese Dream
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 1 · Location 175
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    China doesn’t want to be a superpower—one pole of many in the international system. It wants to be the superpower—the geopolitical sun around which the system revolves.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 3 · Location 195
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The CCP’s agenda blends a sense of China’s historical destiny with an emphasis on modern, twenty-first century tools of power. It is rooted in the timeless geopolitical ambitions that motivate so many great powers and the insatiable insecurities that plague China’s authoritarian regime.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 3 · Location 201
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Discerning what China wants can be tricky, because countries that want to overturn the status quo have every reason to conceal their goals. The CCP, moreover, is a secretive authoritarian party that feels no compunction about deceiving outsiders or even its own people.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 4 · Location 214

<div class="noteText">
    First, the CCP has the eternal ambition of every autocratic regime—to maintain its iron grip on power. China is not what Americans would consider a normal state that hashes out its national interests through open argument and elections. China has political debates, but they occur exclusively within a one-party state in which the supremacy of the CCP is written into the constitution.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

    “Empires have no interest in operating within an international system,” writes Henry Kissinger. “They aspire to be the international system.” 24 That’s the ultimate ambition of Chinese statecraft today.

    There is, for starters, the unrelenting military buildup. China’s inflation-adjusted military spending spending grew 10-fold between 1990 and 2020, a rate of sustained expansion unparalleled in modern history.

    All this means the sources of Chinese conduct are not tied to any one leader. America has a China problem, not a Xi Jinping problem. The CCP’s revisionist project began before Xi took office; it has deep roots in the nature of international politics and the nature of the Chinese regime.

    2. Peak China

<div class="noteText">
    Beginning in the 1970s, China benefited from a serendipitous combination of five factors: an unusually welcoming geopolitical environment; a leadership committed to economic reform; institutional changes that diluted one-man rule and empowered a professional bureaucracy; the greatest demographic dividend in history; and an abundance of natural resources.

    First, it turned the United States from a mortal enemy into a quasi-ally. The United States began withdrawing its forces from Vietnam and Taiwan; it started backing China as a Cold War counterweight to the Soviet Union. Henry Kissinger shared sensitive intelligence on Soviet troop movements and warned Moscow that an attack on China would be an attack on America’s vital interests. 6 When China invaded Soviet ally Vietnam in 1979, the United States again warned Moscow not to interfere. 7 Thanks to the quirks of Cold War geopolitics, Beijing now had a superpower on its side.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 29 · Location 589

<div class="noteText">
    Second, the opening to America fast-tracked China’s integration with the wider world. The United Nations made Beijing, not Taipei, the holder of China’s seats in the General Assembly and Security Council. The PRC began its entry into institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Country after country switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing; Japan, China’s historical enemy, became its largest aid donor. With these new diplomatic connections, China was able to counter-encircle the Soviet Union, forging partnerships with Soviet neighbors stretching from Japan through Iran to West Germany. Third, rapprochement allowed a breakout from economic purgatory. For the first time, the PRC was able to reduce military spending and focus on economic development. The end of hostility with the West meant access to global commerce and safety for Chinese shipping. China had the best of all worlds—a secure homeland and easy access to foreign capital, technology, and consumers. The greatest oddity of the current Sino-American antagonism is that it was reconciliation with Washington that freed China from perpetual insecurity and immiseration. And the timing could not have been better, because China also had, at last, a government that could exploit this opportunity.

    The CCP has never been anything but authoritarian. It has rarely hesitated to use the most lethal forms of repression when threatened.

    In the 2000s, China had a remarkable ten working-age adults for every senior citizen aged 65 or older. 14 For most major economies, the average is closer to five. China’s extreme demographic advantage was the happy upshot of wild policy fluctuations.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 33 · Location 645

<div class="noteText">
    As a result, by the 1990s, China had a huge baby-boom generation entering the prime of their working lives with relatively few elderly parents or young children to care for. No population has ever been more primed for productivity. Demographers think this imbalance alone explains a quarter of China’s rapid growth during the 1990s and 2000s.

    By 2050, the country will only have two workers available to support every retiree (compared to ten workers for every retiree in the early 2000s), and nearly one-third of the country will be over the age of sixty. 20 China’s population will be just half its current size by the end of the century and perhaps as soon as the 2060s. 21 The economic consequences will be dire. Current projections suggest China’s age-related spending will need to triple as a share of GDP, from 10 percent to 30 percent, over the next thirty years to provide a basic level of elder care—to prevent senior citizens from dying in the streets. 22 To put that in perspective, consider that all of China’s government spending currently totals about 30 percent of GDP. China will somehow have to raise this astronomical amount of revenue from a collapsing tax base and a less productive workforce, as it loses nearly 200 million working-age adults while gaining nearly 200 million senior citizens. Not least, China will have to care for its ballooning elderly population without its traditional source of social security: family. The average Chinese thirty-something currently has fifty living cousins—plenty of breadwinners to support grandma. By the 2050s, however, that number will have dropped fivefold. At that point, 40 percent of Chinese under the age of fifty will be only children with few if any close blood relatives, except aging parents that they have to support alone.

    No doubt, the Soviets had other problems, including sinking oil revenues and sky-high defense spending; and China has additional advantages, including a market-oriented private sector and a growing middle class. But China’s productivity problem is strikingly similar to what afflicted the Soviet Union: state-directed investment piling up in stagnant parts of the economy. China’s private sector is dynamic, but it is shackled to a bloated state sector that destroys more value than it creates.

    Even close U.S. allies, such as France and Germany, sometimes seem wishy-washy. Still scarred by the memory of one cold war, these countries are eager to avoid a second that once again splits the world down the middle. China exacerbates this hedging by using its economic influence to divide and neutralize regional groupings, whether ASEAN or, on occasion, the European Union. Moreover, what governments want is one thing and what businesses want is another: As Washington and Tokyo sought to limit dependence on China in 2020–2021, U.S. and Japanese investment flowed into that country.

It has built an entente with Putin’s Russia, another angry, revisionist autocracy with a penchant for aggression and a talent for making enemies. That partnership features deepening economic, technological, diplomatic, and military cooperation beyond what most Western observers would have predicted a decade ago. It features a tacit agreement that Beijing and Moscow won’t make trouble for each other along their once-contested border, so that they can maximize the trouble they make for the United States and its allies across Eurasia and beyond.

Perversely, expansion also left Tokyo more reliant on its potential enemies for resources to keep the war machine humming.

    In a twist of fate, “Communist” China now looks primed for capitalist imperialism. Its economy is glutted with excess capacity generated by decades of subprime lending. The main markets where it used to dump its products—North America, Europe, and Japan—are increasingly unwilling to absorb an endless flood of Chinese goods. Since 2008, China has responded to these trends with a two-step plan. First, lend more than a trillion dollars to foreigners so they buy enough Chinese goods and services to keep CCP Inc. in business. 13 Second, use the proceeds to become a technological powerhouse by pumping investment into R& D, buying and stealing foreign technology, and using subsidies and trade barriers to protect Chinese firms from foreign competition. The resulting surge of innovation, Beijing hopes, will reinvigorate China’s economy and boost its power.

China’s banks have set aside tens of billions of dollars to lend to more than 1,000 Chinese firms in strategic industries, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, advanced robotics, and synthetic biology. 27 The objective is for China to produce 70 percent of key components in strategic industries by the end of the decade. To meet that goal, Beijing is pressing private tech firms into national service, tapping their data, and obliging them to develop new technologies and hand them over to the government—part of another innocuous-sounding doctrine called “civil-military fusion.”

Huawei claims to have cloud computing contracts with 140 countries; another Chinese company, Hengtong Group, has installed 15 percent of the world’s fiber optics. 35 China’s BeiDou satellite network has been adopted by dozens of countries and provides greater coverage over 165 of the world’s capital cities than does the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS). 36 China’s gains in global networks could be long-lasting, because telecom and satellite infrastructures are extremely expensive to replace.

    The liberal belief, so common in the 1990s, that democracy would inevitably spread around the world will be upended. So will the comforting myth that humanity has evolved past the point of mass atrocities. Digital authoritarianism is not a substitute for gulags and genocide; it is an enabler. Political scientists have shown that when dictatorships ramp up digital repression, they also engage in more torture and murder. 58 The reason is simple: With machines handling day-to-day bookkeeping and surveillance, foot soldiers are free to focus on the physical aspects of authoritarian rule, such as ethnic cleansing and beating dissidents into submission. Just look at Xinjiang, where smart cities exist side-by-side with concentration camps. 59 Chinese security officers man the camps and handle the “reeducation” and forced sterilization, while cameras, biometric scanners, and mandatory cell-phone apps feed data into computers that keep tabs on everything that happens in the province. Algorithms match camera footage with snapshots, blood samples, and DNA swabs taken by police at “health checks.” When Uighurs reach the edge of their neighborhood, their cell phones automatically alert authorities. When they pump gas, the system checks whether they are the car’s owner. If they try to flee the province, police are dispatched to the doorsteps of their family and friends. If they somehow make it abroad, they aren’t guaranteed an escape: China’s authoritarian allies, even those in Muslim-majority countries such as Egypt, are starting to use Chinese surveillance technology to track down and deport Uighurs back into Beijing’s clutches.

Recruits receive only a few weeks of basic training, and training for reservists is infrequent and inadequate. Taiwan also has gutted its logistics force, which now routinely fails to resupply combat units or perform basic maintenance. Consequently, soldiers avoid training with their weapons for fear of accidents or wasting precious ammunition; Taiwan’s pilots fly for less than ten hours per month. More than half of Taiwan’s tanks and attack helicopters are dysfunctional, and many Taiwanese soldiers suffer low morale.

The PRC has had only one completely formalized and orderly leadership succession in its history: when Xi himself took office in 2012.18 The pre-PRC period isn’t any more reassuring: Half of China’s 282 emperors across 49 dynasties were murdered, overthrown, forced to abdicate, or compelled to commit suicide. 19 Less than half of them chose a successor, the majority only in the last years of their reign, and these successors were typically murdered by political rivals. 20 In short, violent chaos is common, and anything is possible.

    Yet an alternative, and more likely, outcome is that Xi is replaced by a Chinese Putin, a vengeful streetfighter who oversees China’s transition from aspiring superpower to prickly spoiler. The threat of China as a peer-competitor will be fading rapidly. But in its place will emerge a giant rogue state aiming to defend itself by subverting an international order it can no longer hope to dominate.

    And Beijing will continue to crack down hard on dissent at home. The Uighurs and Tibetans will be detained and sterilized out of existence, and the CCP panopticon will be upgraded and expanded continually.

    Maybe China will collapse into civil war. Maybe some of its technological moonshots, meant to rescue the country from decline, will pay off. Maybe something totally unexpected will happen. If the short-term threat from China is undeniable, the country’s long-term status remains an open question.

    Looking beyond the 2020s, Washington must find a sustainable strategy. In protracted contests, not competing everywhere is the price of being effective anywhere. America must determine where it will do whatever it takes to stay ahead of Beijing (in the East Asian military balance and the tech rivalry, for instance) and where the energy is not worth the reward (in Central Asia and parts of Africa, for example).

    The United States didn’t win the Cold War by treating that contest as a purely bilateral duel. America blocked Soviet aggression and bankrupted Soviet ideology by shaping a better world for the countries that took its side. 24

    Beijing has a habit of blowing up at the slightest criticism, thereby reminding other countries how unpleasant Chinese hegemony will be. That tendency is rooted in Xi’s regime, which seems to have trouble distinguishing between behavior that works for a dictator at home and behavior that wins allies abroad.

    America’s internal problems are real, and the United States won’t profit from China’s decline if the domestic foundations of its own power also collapse. A list of repairs would include revamping immigration policy to ensure a growing population with plenty of high-skilled workers, reinvesting in education and basic research, revitalizing the country’s physical and digital infrastructure, combating corruption, and mitigating polarization that has effects ranging from political gridlock to political violence. 29 The great strength of America’s democracy is resilience, and the country has come through worse periods before—during the 1930s, when the future of capitalism and democracy were in doubt, or even the late 1960s, when domestic upheaval and violence were rampant. Yet domestic rejuvenation will be essential to prosecuting Sino-American rivalry.

    An eighth point involves a counterintuitive approach to the unholy entente between Russia and China: Pushing your rivals together may be a prelude to pulling them apart. So long as Russia and China are on their current trajectories, with their current leadership, there probably isn’t much the United States can do to induce a breakup. Trying to pull a “reverse Kissinger”—using clever diplomacy to peel Putin away from Xi, in imitation of the U.S. opening to China during the 1970s—wouldn’t work. Sino-Russian relations aren’t nearly combustible enough to produce the sort of blowup that happened in the late 1960s, and any bid to buy Moscow’s cooperation through geopolitical concessions would just destabilize Europe at a crucial time. A related approach, one of dramatically reducing the U.S. commitment to NATO to focus exclusively on Asia, would blow a gaping hole in America’s global posture and alienate many of the European democracies Washington needs on its side against Beijing.

    If the United States and its allies wish to promote an eventual strategic rethink in Moscow, they must first prove that Russia’s policy of geopolitical revisionism and alignment with Beijing will not pay—and that the alternative to tolerable relations with the West is ever-increasing dependence on a China whose abrasiveness and ambition know few bounds. In the same vein, distancing Beijing from Moscow may require showing, repeatedly, that Russian adventures will make life harder for China by stimulating greater fears of autocratic aggression and rallying democracies everywhere to strengthen the order Xi aims to overturn.

    America’s task, in this decade, is to prevent a peaking China from imposing its will on the world. Yet strategic urgency must be followed by strategic patience: Washington’s reward for getting through the danger zone could be a ticket to a longer struggle in which America’s advantages prove decisive only over a generation or more. That may seem like a meager prize for a country that likes quick, decisive solutions. But it is surely worth winning, in view of the perils that America and the world confront today.
