    Introduction
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 121
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The basic conclusion also stands: China is too bogged down in the security challenges within and around its borders to threaten the West unless the West weakens itself to the point of creating a power vacuum.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 130
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Great power is a vague term, but China deserves it by any measure: the extent and strategic location of its territory, the size and dynamism of its population, the value and growth rate of its economy, its massive share of global trade, the size and sophistication of its military, the reach of its diplomatic interests, and its level of cultural influence.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 142
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Over the course of three decades, the West opened its markets, provided loans and investments, transferred technology (with a few limits related to military applications), trained Chinese students, provided advice on laws and institutions, and helped China enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) (although negotiating hard over the conditions of China’s entry; see chapter 10). American and more generally Western support had incalculable financial and technological value to China, and it is not an exaggeration to say that Western support made China’s rise possible.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 162
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The main tasks of Chinese foreign policy are still defensive: to blunt destabilizing influences from abroad, to avoid territorial losses, to moderate surrounding states’ suspicions, and to create international conditions that will sustain economic growth. What has changed is that these internal and regional priorities are now embedded in a larger quest: to define a global role that serves Chinese interests but also wins acceptance from other powers.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 181
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Paying attention to culture does not mean cultural relativism: a country’s core security interests are intelligible to an analyst from any culture. But to understand how they are being talked about requires a process of interpretation.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 211
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The political science field of international relations also presents two other useful perspectives on how to understand the drivers of a country’s foreign policy: constructivism, the theory that a state’s interests as well as its strategies to achieve these interests are constructed through actors’ use of perceptions, values, and ideas to understand and react to their situations; and institutionalism, a theory that emphasizes how states, once they engage themselves in institutional arrangements (such as treaties and international organizations), become constrained by these sets of rules in patterns of “complex interdependence” as a result of the benefits they gain from using such prearranged channels to work with other states toward common goals. We also draw occasionally from a fourth theory in the field, liberalism, which draws attention to the role of a country’s domestic interest groups in making foreign policy.

<div class="noteText">
    Realism tells us that security is the ability to maintain effective control over one’s own political regime, economy, way of life, borders, and population.

<div class="noteText">
    In the 1950s, Chinese leaders took the U.S. as their main enemy, and in the 1960s the USSR; in the 1970s, they positioned themselves as leading the Third World against two hegemons in the search for a world of peace and stability for development; then in the 1990s they seemed again to see the U.S. as the main threat to their security; and now, at a time when the U.S. is perhaps more unilateralist in its behavior and has more military forces near China than ever, they seem to believe that the two countries can find a way to balance one another and cooperate to achieve mutual interests.

<div class="noteText">
    the growth of the Chinese economy has benefited the U.S. economy by providing a market for American goods, supplying cheap, high-quality consumer products, and soaking up U.S. government debt, among a multitude of ways.

    The methods of protection are now more virtual than physical—among them a nonconvertible currency, regulatory obstacles to full foreign access to the domestic economy, repression of independent civil society organizations that have foreign connections, active police surveillance of foreigners and foreign-connected Chinese, and the so-called Great Firewall that restricts the Chinese Internet’s access to the international Internet.

    the U.S. has a vastly larger economy and stronger military, with true global reach. Japan has a better-financed, more technologically advanced military. India, with a similar-size population and territory, albeit a smaller gross domestic product (GDP), has a more advantageous geostrategic position and a better-equipped navy and air force. And the European Union (EU) has a large population, a continental strategic position, a larger GDP, and more advanced technology. Why is it that, except for the U.S., these other powers languish, relatively speaking, in the global shadows, generating neither the respect nor the fear that China does?

The contiguous states include seven of the fifteen largest countries in the world (India, Pakistan, Russia, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam—each having a population greater than 89 million); five countries with which China has been at war at some point in the past seventy years (Russia, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and India); and at least nine countries with unstable regimes (including North Korea, the Philippines, Myanmar/ Burma, 1 Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan).

    To get the country to develop self-reliantly, Mao Zedong and his colleagues devised a strategy modeled on Stalinism but with a number of unique features. They created large communes with no private ownership of land, restricted the migration of rural residents to the cities, used ideological campaigns instead of material incentives to mobilize human energies, and applied political terror and indoctrination to make people accept low living standards. The population found itself organized into work units—communes, factories, offices, and schools—that controlled all aspects of daily life. The ruling party deterred opposition by mobilizing mass persecutions of designated “class enemies.” This totalitarian model produced industrialization at a rapid pace, but at a huge human cost.

    “Reform” meant liberalizing the domestic economic and administrative systems; “opening” meant abandoning autarky in relations with the rest of the world. The two were linked.

Classic examples of this problem have included the failure of military-run enterprises to comply with nonproliferation commitments made by central officials, 17 local officials’ toleration of intellectual property rights violations, 18 and human rights violations carried out by security authorities that embarrassed the foreign ministry and the justice ministry.

    For example, intelligence agencies appear to have been caught off guard by the scope of the unrest in Tibetan areas in March 2008 and the intensity of outrage among Uyghurs in Xinjiang in July 2009. The reason for the lapse may lie in the agencies’ unwillingness to deliver assessments that embarrass local authorities or contradict current thinking among the leaders. Disaffected Tibetans and Uyghurs are always officially depicted as constituting “a small handful” of troublemakers who have foreign links and do not enjoy broad support in their communities. This view may also be reflected in internal reporting. To suggest that disaffection is deeply rooted and widespread would challenge the official belief that economic development in areas populated by ethnic minorities is the answer to the problem. Moreover, it is easier to blame foreign instigators for the unexpected scope and intensity of domestic dissent than to say that government policies have failed.

It learned from the Soviets how to set up a central party apparatus to run a government rather than a war; how to manage government ministries; how to create a system of courts, procurators, police, and jails; how to embed political security functions into factories, universities, offices, and other work units; how to set up Soviet-style mass organizations; and how to use the network of newspaper reporters around the country as a supplementary intelligence service.

    First, Chinese analysts draw on a set of ideas that are part of Chinese strategic culture, which include “preconceived stereotypes of the strategic disposition of [China and other countries] derived from a selective interpretation of history, traditions and self-image.” 2 They see their own country as heir to an “oriental” strategic tradition that dates back thousands of years and that is pacific, defensive minded, and nonexpansionist. They consider China’s approach to interstate relations ethically fair and reasonable, and they attribute the existence of this unusual approach to the fact that China is a continental power that was historically agrarian and sedentary. In contrast, they see Western strategic culture as militaristic, offensive minded, and expansionist, growing out of the experience of maritime powers that are mobile and mercantilist. The two images define each other by contrast.

    First, American military forces are globally deployed and technologically advanced, with massive concentrations of firepower all around the Chinese rim. The U.S. military is divided into six regional “combatant commands,” of which the largest in geographic scope and manpower9 is the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), whose area of responsibility includes China. (There are also four functional commands.) PACOM has its headquarters in Honolulu and has forces stationed throughout Asia and the Pacific. More than 230 of the 800 U.S. overseas military installations are located in Japan and South Korea, and there are major air and naval bases on the island of Guam, 2,000 miles from China. 10 Besides China, PACOM’s area of responsibility includes Taiwan, the South China Sea, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and most of the Pacific and Indian oceans. As of 2010, PACOM’s assets included about 325,000 military personnel from the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps; some 180 ships, 1,500 navy and marine aircraft, and 400 air force aircraft. 11 Among PACOM’s components are the Third Fleet and Seventh Fleet and, most of the time, five of the eleven U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups. At the western borders of China and India, PACOM gives way to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). CENTCOM is responsible for the area from Pakistan and Central Asia west to Egypt. Before September 11, 2001, CENTCOM had no forces stationed directly on China’s borders except for its training and supply missions in Pakistan, but after

    The makeup of China’s foreign exchange reserves is not publicly known, but they probably include about 70 percent of dollar-denominated assets. Even if China would like to hold fewer dollar assets, it is hard to do so when the dollar accounts for nearly half of international bank deposits and debt securities, 60 percent of global foreign exchange reserves, and 80 percent of all foreign exchange transactions. 14 The dollar’s ubiquity gives the U.S. the ability to damage Chinese interests simply by trying to solve its own economic problems by printing dollars and borrowing. When the U.S. does these things, it drives down the value of both China’s exports and its foreign exchange reserves.

    the Chinese believe that the Americans dragged out the negotiations, drove an unduly hard bargain, and ratcheted up their demands in bad faith at the last moment when Premier Zhu Rongji came to Washington in 1999 to offer what China thought would be final concessions. After initially agreeing to Zhu’s offer, President Bill Clinton cited congressional dissatisfaction with the deal as a reason for demanding still more concessions. The lessons of this experience for Beijing were that the U.S. never relents even on minor details, that negotiating with the U.S. is politicized and chaotic because no one is fully in charge, and that the U.S. drives the hardest possible bargain to maximize its own benefits rather than seeking a fair deal that serves both sides.

    When Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, he told the Chinese that he was willing to sacrifice Taiwan because it would no longer be strategically important to the U.S. once the U.S. and China started cooperating. But he told Mao and Zhou that it was politically impossible to sever ties with Taipei at the same time that he opened ties with Beijing. He promised to break diplomatic and military relations with the ROC in his second term. After hard bargaining, the Chinese side accepted this two-step solution. In the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, they restated their absolutist position—“[ T] he liberation of Taiwan is China’s internal affair in which no other country has the right to interfere; and all U.S. forces and military installations must be withdrawn from Taiwan”—but they also allowed the U.S. to make a parallel declaration within the same document. The crucial language in the communiqué reads as follows. The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves. With this prospect in mind, it affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes.

    In this way, the Chinese obtained what they read as a definitive acknowledgment of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and a commitment to end U.S. military support for the ROC government. Yet U.S. negotiators later maintained that they had not “recognized” (chengren) Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan but merely “acknowledged” (renshi) the Chinese belief in this sovereignty. As for Washington’s pledge to break relations with Taipei, it was an oral side promise, not a written commitment, and it turned out to be hard to achieve. Although the U.S. undertook to reduce its military presence in Taiwan, it made this reduction contingent on the reduction of the Chinese military threat, a threat that Chinese negotiators had always insisted was a sovereign right that they could not give away. The U.S. even paradoxically managed to tighten its commitment to Taiwan while loosening it: it asserted a never-before-stated “interest” in the manner in which the Taiwan question would be settled (i.e., peacefully), an interest that it would later use to justify continuing to support Taiwan militarily and in some ways diplomatically even after it broke formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.

After tense negotiations, as part of the deal to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing on January 1, 1979, Washington agreed to break diplomatic relations with Taipei, give the legally required one-year notice of termination of the Mutual Defense Treaty, “recognize” the PRC government as “the sole legal government of China,” and say again that it “acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.” 20 The U.S. insisted, however, on including a sentence in the joint normalization communiqué that said, “Within this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.” Moreover, despite Chinese objections, the U.S. issued a unilateral statement that said that “the United States continues to have an interest in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and expects that

In the Chinese view none of this was done out of idealism or generosity. Meanwhile, until the late 1990s, American strategists underestimated China’s potential.

First, it gave China the right to counsel Pyongyang against rash action and diminished the incentive for North Korea to lash out in panic. Second, it helped to deter an attack on Pyongyang by other states. Finally, the treaty would provide a justification if China ever felt that it needed to intervene militarily on Korean soil.

In the economic category, first, Beijing is engaged in a quest for secure sources of petroleum to help satisfy its growing need for energy. Second, more generally, it seeks access to other commodities and to markets and investments around the world. Third, Beijing is engaged in arms sales, chiefly for profit rather than for strategic reasons. On the diplomatic front, fourth, China seeks cooperative relations with as many regimes as possible in order to protect economic access. Fifth, Chinese diplomats work country by country to maintain China’s policy of diplomatically isolating Taiwan and the Dalai Lama. Sixth, China seeks support from Fourth Ring governments for its position in a range of multilateral negotiations over international norms and regimes.

    For example, in the 1980s, China’s sale of shore-to-ship Silkworm missiles to Iran created a new threat for U.S. warships sailing in the Persian Gulf, and the sale of CSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia, M-9 and M-11 missiles to Syria, and a nuclear reactor to Algeria posed threats to U.S. allies and the risk of fueling local arms races. After strenuous negotiations, the U.S. prevailed on China to stop these sales. These agreements left China by the mid-1990s with a market in small arms, light weapons, aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, small ships, and the like. It briefly became the world’s fourth-largest exporter of conventional weapons.

    If China relied mostly on positive incentives to win cooperation for its Taiwan policy in the Fourth Ring, it could also be tough on occasion. In 1995, it used its position on the UN Security Council to reduce the size of the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti because the Haitians had invited Taiwan’s vice president to attend the inauguration of their new president. (China later took a more positive attitude and sent police and judicial experts to participate in the Haiti mission.) In 1997, the PRC vetoed a Security Council resolution to deploy military observers to monitor a cease-fire in Guatemala because Guatemala maintained diplomatic relations with the ROC. (It allowed the resolution to pass on a second vote after Guatemala agreed to stop supporting Taiwan’s bid for participation in the UN.)

The smaller states often had less settled positions than the larger states either because they had less at stake or because they lacked the staff to gain expertise on the issues. Working with Fourth Ring friends helped Beijing’s diplomats influence the outcome documents in many areas. For example, they tried to restrict the conditions under which a government’s failure to exercise its “responsibility to protect” its people might lead to an international intervention; established the principle that all states should be subjected to the same human rights review, not just selected states (nonselectivity); and fought for each government’s right to regulate its own domestic Internet.

    For China to become a strategic actor in the Fourth Ring will require more than an expansion of its economic presence. It will require China to cultivate ideological and cultural influence, build military bases, sign defense treaties, and find ways to project significant military power thousand of miles from its own shores.

    Yet resistance to Chinese rule did not weaken; indeed, it seemed to strengthen. Most Tibetans consider reverence of the Dalai Lama central to their faith.

    The government claimed that the perpetrators’ goal was to separate Xinjiang from China, that Uyghur separatists were terrorists, and that Uyghur separatism was linked to al-Qaeda. All these claims were controversial because most Uyghurs are either secular or practice a moderate form of Sunni Islam, the resistance does not seem to be organized, and the community has not coalesced around specific demands. Many incidents reported by Chinese authorities as part of a terrorist, separatist movement seem to have had diverse and sometimes personal causes and often to have resulted in low casualties.

    Although China portrays Rebiya Kadeer, like the Dalai Lama, as a powerful outside instigator of troubles within, in fact her influence is less extensive than his, even among her own ethnic group, not to mention among foreign governments and publics, and the Uyghur community remains internally divided. Despite rising international criticism of Chinese human rights violations in Xinjiang, no outside government supports the idea of an independent Uyghur state. The exile community’s main achievement has been to keep Uyghur identity alive.
