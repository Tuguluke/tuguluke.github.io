    Then, on March 12, 1947, in a speech before a joint session of Congress, Harry S. Truman relieved the situation of ambiguity. “At the present moment in world history,” Truman said, “nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life.”

    This meant that the outcome of their rivalry could not properly be decided by military superiority alone, since the matter was not finally about brute strength. It was about ideas, and ideas in the broadest sense—about economic and political doctrines, civic and personal values, modes of expression, philosophies of history, theories of human nature, the meaning of truth.

    What Kennan admired about the United States was the value it placed on the freedom of thought—the supreme good for Cold War intellectuals. Toward American life generally, though, he had the attitude of the typical midcentury European: he thought that Americans were shallow, materialistic, and self-centered. He was firmly anti-majoritarian, not only in foreign affairs, where he considered public opinion a menace, but also in governmental decision-making generally.

    Kennan was caustic. “The Russians have a long-term consistent policy,” as he recorded his comments in his diary. “We have—and they know we have—a fluctuating policy reflecting only the momentary fancies of public opinion in the United States. We are incapable of conceiving and executing a long-term consistent policy. The Russians know from this that if they only wait long enough they can always find, sooner or later, a situation in which they can get what they want from us … In their opinion, as one of them recently told me, nothing is impossible.” 53

    Kennan put all of this in a long letter to Bohlen in January 1945. The United States, he argued, should abandon Eastern Europe to the Soviets, accept the division of Germany, and give up plans for the United Nations, which he considered a classic case of political wishful thinking.

    At Kennan’s suggestion, Marshall aid was open to all countries, including the nations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Kennan knew that Stalin would refuse the aid and would compel his satellites to refuse it as well—which he did, thereby assuming some of the blame for the Cold War division of Europe. 101

    Faithful to the choreography of Cold War geopolitics, Moscow’s steps were virtually synchronous. On March 28, 1947, seven days after Truman ordered the loyalty program for federal employees, the Central Committee of the Communist Party established a Court of Honor charged with investigating Western influences on Soviet art and science. This was an institutionalization of Zhdanovshchina, the Zhdanov Doctrine, a campaign against artistic formalism and other evidence of creeping Westernization that had been implemented in 1946 by the Kremlin’s chief ideologist, Andrei Zhdanov. On September 22, 1947, the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau—Cominform—was held in the resort town of Skłarska Poręba in Polish Silesia, a region from which hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans had recently been deported. The Cominform was Stalin’s response to the Marshall Plan.

    The key term in Morgenthau’s theory was “power.” “Man’s aspiration for power is not an accident of history,” he wrote in an essay a year before the big book appeared; “it is not a temporary deviation from a normal state of freedom; it is an all-permeating fact which is of the very essence of human existence.”

    As Arnold Wolfers, a professor of international relations at Yale who had emigrated from Germany in 1933, put it: an Anglo-American “philosophy of moral choice,” which assumes that nations are free to pursue their goals and moral convictions, was in conflict with a European “philosophy of necessity,” which assumes that nations pursue their interests.

    The Second World War “was a war for survival, undertaken by individual nations in their own national interest, not the punitive war of a morally united humanity for the purpose of making eternal justice prevail.” 120 Kennan, too, regarded the Nuremberg Trials with “horror.” 121 He thought the United States had no moral standing to judge what Germany had done in the East. In the single allusion to the Holocaust in the two volumes of his Memoirs, he says that it was not America’s business.

    Kennan thought, similarly, that the only way to have prevented the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe would have been for the American army to get there first. Great powers such as Germany and Russia have always had “spheres of influence.” It is unrealistic to pretend that states within those spheres have an absolute right to self-determination, or that, if they do, it is the business of the United States to secure it.

    “Power always thinks it has a great Soul,” John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson. 125 After Europe destroyed itself in the Second World War, the United States had power over other nations to a degree unprecedented in its history, possibly in the world’s history, and it was natural for Americans to conclude that they deserved it—that their good fortune had moral validation. Kennan worried that such a belief could become a high-minded justification for interference in the affairs of other nations. He thought that Americans needed to be realists because they could not trust themselves to be moralists.

    Most people who wrote about totalitarianism analyzed it as a product, or a disease, of modernity. They also understood it, more specifically, not merely as a consequence of political and economic developments since the Enlightenment (or the French Revolution, or the rise of industrial capitalism), but as a response to the existential condition of twentieth-century human beings.

    But his principal targets were the Soviet apologists in the British press. “Their attitude towards Russian foreign policy is not ‘Is this policy right or wrong?’ but ‘This is Russian policy: how can we make it appear right?’” he complained. “And this attitude is defended, if at all, solely on grounds of power. The Russians are powerful in Eastern Europe, we are not: therefore we must not oppose them. This involves the principle, of its nature alien to Socialism, that you must not protest against an evil which you cannot prevent.”

    Burnham was a realist, but a different kind of realist from Morgenthau and Kennan. For them, realism was a theory of international relations designed to avoid conflict by acknowledging it. For Burnham, the logical consequence of acknowledging conflict was to take the upper hand. Realism made him a hawk.

    Allied commanders acceded to de Gaulle’s request that a unit of the Free French Forces be the first to enter the city. It seems to have been important to everyone concerned, the Americans and the British as well as de Gaulle, that the troops be white. Because many of their soldiers were recruited from French colonies in Africa, most of the Free French divisions were majority nonwhite. One exception was the Second Armored Division, commanded by Philippe Leclerc, which was 75 percent white. It was chosen to lead the advance.

    The intellectual path Sartre took to that position was, in a word, un-French. It arose out of his encounters with two realms of achievement not frequently associated: German philosophy and American fiction. That Sartre transformed those influences into, first, a philosophy of resistance to the German occupation, and, later on, a philosophy of resistance to American power—that he fashioned them into a worldview that seemed to many people quintessentially French—is not perverse.

    At first, Sartre avoided the term “existentialism.” This may have been partly because of its associations with Existenzphilosophie—that is, with German philosophy—and partly because “existentialism” was already being used by Christian thinkers influenced by Kierkegaard, such as the French philosopher Gabriel Marcel. Mainly, though, it was because Sartre didn’t want to foreclose an alliance with the Communists, with whom he had had patchy relations during the Occupation.

    Beauvoir interpreted the vogue of existentialism as a sort of compensation for this loss of genuine international influence. “[ N] ow a second-class power,” she wrote in her memoirs, “France was exalting her most characteristic national products with an eye on the export market: haute couture and literature … Other countries were affected by the racket and seemed only too happy to make it even louder.” 160

    Existentialism became something more than a philosophy. It became a fashion, a mode of thought—even the name for a way of life. It flooded the cultural field.

    Arendt was hostile to causal and empirical interpretations, and she was hostile to theoretical interpretations as well—for example, Marxist interpretations. She thought that they blind us to the meaning of what happened. “What is the subject of our thought? Experience! Nothing else!” she insisted at a conference on her work toward the end of her life. “And if we lose the ground of experience then we get into all kinds of theories. When the political theorist begins to build his systems he is also usually dealing with abstraction.” 43 Not the lectern and the apricot cocktail but the experience of the lectern and the cocktail is the proper object of understanding. It is a phenomenological approach to history. Arendt thought of history writing as storytelling—or, in a metaphor she used to describe Benjamin’s method, pearl diving. 44 This is why The Origins of Totalitarianism is a kind of evil fairy tale, a lurid animation of the underside of European history. Some readers complained that Arendt’s long expositions on anti-Semitism and imperialism didn’t add up to an explanation for totalitarianism. But that was, quite self-consciously, not her intention. “The main stylistic task of this study,” she explained to her editor, “… is to avoid the inherent law of all historiography which is preservation and justification and praise; and to present its result in such a way that it serves the opposite and intrinsically unhistoric purpose of destruction. The elements which should be eliminated from Western tradition and thought are prepared in the form of historical cross-sections. The author never aims at presenting history as a whole.” 45

    The stateless people therefore constituted “the most symptomatic group in contemporary politics.” 51 For those people were not criminals. They had done nothing wrong. They were victims simply of who they were. They could change their behavior and they could change their loyalty, but they could not change that. “Once they had left their homeland they remained homeless,” Arendt wrote; “once they had left their state they became stateless; once they had been deprived of their human rights they were rightless, the scum of the earth. Nothing which was being done, no matter how stupid, no matter how many people knew and foretold the consequences, could be undone or prevented. Every event had the finality of a last judgment, a judgment that was passed neither by God nor by the devil, but looked rather like the expression of some unredeemably stupid fatality.” 52 They were living under an empty sky.

    What was unusual about Arendt’s book were two distinctions she drew. One was a distinction between ideas and ideology. Even though it was written by someone trained as a philosopher, The Origins of Totalitarianism is a work of political, not intellectual, history. It does not explain totalitarianism by means of a story about Western thought, which has always been a popular way to come to grips with the subject—as Karl Popper did in The Open Society and Its Enemies, as the Polish émigré Jacob Talmon did in The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy, published in Britain a year after Arendt’s book, and as the Oxford philosopher Isaiah Berlin, a Russian émigré, who detested Arendt’s work, would do in many lectures and essays.

This was because philosophy—that is, thinking—is done in solitude, and politics is practiced with others. 67 Politics concerns action. Philosophy concerns truth, and truth is an absolute. It is not a safe criterion to use to guide political choices. What modern politicians discovered, Arendt believed, was the use not of ideas, but of ideology.

Fromm’s theory was that in modern society, freedom produces anxiety, and totalitarian ideology promises an “escape” from that anxiety. Before the modern era, freedom was something people fought for, but in modern societies, it is a condition of life without evident value in itself. It produces not commitment but aimlessness.

    Autonomy, independence, and self-realization are correlates of “freedom,” but they are all relative states within a regime—human life—that is heteronomous through and through. Freedom is not natural; it is carved out of a system of socialization and coercion, and it requires its own system of coercions to be maintained. As an absolute, freedom is the equivalent of arbitrariness and anarchy, and socially meaningless. So what politicians and writers meant when they used the word “freedom” was obvious in a rhetorical sense—people could be assumed to prefer freedom to whatever they imagined the alternative to be—but not at all obvious in a philosophical or legal sense.

He wanted a world that is rational and demystified, and in which human beings are liberated from the control of external forces.

Freedom is a function of material conditions.

    In such a world, all freedoms are “driving a car” freedoms. They are ideological constructs, self-delusions, not authentic states of being. Until capitalism collapses of its own contradictions and is replaced by a classless society, “freedom” is a mode of false consciousness. True freedom means understanding the real nature of social relations and grasping that one is the instrument of an economic system, which is the first step in de-instrumentalizing yourself. And that, in turn, requires understanding the logic of history, and seeing that the capitalist order is only a stage in a historical unfolding whose final end is communism, which Marx called “the riddle of history solved.”

But he also thought that Marx subordinated everything to a deterministic theory of history, knowledge of which is the monopoly of a small group, and that this made him “among the great authoritarian founders of new faiths, ruthless subverters and innovators who interpret the world in terms of a single, clear, passionately held principle, denouncing and destroying all that conflicts with it. His faith … was of that boundless, absolute kind which puts an end to all questions and dissolves all difficulties.” 16

    The most widely known of those writings is “Two Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin’s inaugural lecture as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford, delivered on October 31, 1958, and published in an expanded version the same year. One reason for the essay’s influence is that it presents four linked but distinct philosophical ideas, each of which had political resonance in 1958. The first is the contrast between negative freedom and positive freedom—the “two concepts.” Negative freedom is “freedom from” external forces of coercion, such as the state; positive freedom is “freedom to” reach particular ends, such as self-realization. The central argument of the essay is that all “freedoms to,” no matter how appealing the ends in view, can become rationales for coercion.*

    “This monstrous impersonation,” Berlin wrote, “which consists in equating what X would choose if he were something he is not, or at least not yet, with what X actually seeks and chooses, is at the heart of all political theories of self-realization.” 42 Self-realization may be a good thing (Berlin obviously considered the notion rather empty), but it is not the same as liberty. Liberty is “freedom from,” and the danger arises when people are persuaded that it is something else. “Everything is what it is,” as Berlin put it in a later edition of the essay: “liberty is liberty, not equality or fairness or justice or culture, or human happiness or a quiet conscience.” 43 “Every thing is what it is” is a famous phrase in British philosophy, and the essence of the empirical view.

    In the geopolitical context, the relevant choice in 1958, the choice everyone would have understood that Berlin was referring to, was liberty and equality. Liberal democracies might argue that what makes liberty true liberty is that everyone has an equal chance; socialist and Communist nations might argue that no one is free as long as there is inequality, such that one person’s liberty rests on the exploitation of another. But the doctrine of incommensurability tells us that both arguments muddle concepts. To get more of one of those goods, we must give up some of the other.

Berlin was now arguing that the authoritarian tendencies of the faith in rationalism were not restricted to Marxism. “[ A] ll forms of liberalism founded on a rationalist metaphysics,” he said, “are less or more watered-down versions of this creed.” 50 He saw totalitarianism not as anti-humanism but as humanism in extremis. Its seeds were everywhere.

    What broke up the Enlightenment faith in reason, Berlin argued in the Mellon lectures, was the European Romanticism of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Romanticism put an end to “the jigsaw-puzzle conception of life,” the assumption that all questions can be answered, and the answers fitted together into a harmonious whole. It taught us “that there are many values, and that they are incompatible; the whole notion of plurality, of inexhaustibility, of the imperfection of all human answers and arrangements; the notion that no single answer which claims to be perfect and true, whether in art or in life, can in principle be perfect or true.” 54 Romanticism rejected the end of self-understanding and replaced it with the end of self-creation. Science, reason, and universalism, the values of Enlightenment thinkers, were replaced by a new set of values: sincerity, authenticity, toleration, variety. It is from this tradition, not the Socratic tradition, that liberal pluralism derives. But, Berlin went on, it is also from this tradition that fascism derives. “The hysterical self-assertion and the nihilistic destruction of existing institutions because they confine the unlimited will … are a direct inheritance” from the Romanticist movement, he said. 55 It seems that same lineage produced completely disparate outcomes—liberal pluralism and fascism—which might suggest that intellectual genealogy is not the most reliable form of historical explanation.

    Politically, a liberty is the flip side of a prohibition. It permits someone to do something by making it illegal for others to interfere. In the American system, liberties are constitutionally instantiated in the form of enumerated rights. These rights are anti-majoritarian: they are trump cards individuals can play when every other hand is against them. But they are not anti-democratic, because the Bill of Rights, and subsequent amendments to the Constitution, were enacted to strengthen, not compromise, democratic practices.

    The term négritude originated in Paris in the 1930s. The French, like the British, had a practice of plucking out talented youth from their colonial populations and educating them in the metropole, with the goal of making them, in effect, nonwhite French persons. It is, looking back, an extraordinary example of the complacency of the imperialist mentality. The French and British somehow imagined that the most intelligent colonial subjects could be assimilated to a racist political and social system by giving them a Western education. What their educations enabled many of those subjects to see, of course, was the hypocrisy of European attitudes about race.

But to live truly, one must be grounded. The actor is the man who does not live truly … Black youth does not want to play any role. It wants to be grounded … It wants neither enslavement nor assimilation. It wants emancipation.” 86 Négritude was a name for that ground. “To make the revolution,” Césaire wrote, it was necessary “to seize within us the immediate negro, to plant our negritude like a beautiful tree until it bears its most authentic fruits.”

    The sentence cited in virtually every review and commentary was: “The Jew is one whom other men consider a Jew.” 99 Sartre offered his standard analysis of this predicament. As he had put it in L’Être et le néant: “there is freedom only in a situation, and there is a situation only through freedom. Human-reality everywhere encounters resistances and obstacles it has not created, but these resistances and obstacles have meaning only in and through the free choice which human-reality is.” 100 In the case of the Jew, he “is in the situation of a Jew because he lives in the midst of a society that takes him for a Jew.” The way to overcome this is not to deny it or erase it, but to own it. “Jewish authenticity consists in choosing oneself as Jew—that is, in realizing one’s Jewish condition.” 101 The ultimate goal of embracing Jewishness is to overcome it.

He was pure gaze … We, who were once divine-right Europeans, were already feeling our dignity crumbling beneath the gaze of the Americans and Soviets … At least we were hoping to recover a little of our grandeur in the menial eyes of the Africans. But there are no menial eyes any longer: there are wild, free gazes that judge our earth. 102 A Jew can deny being Jewish, he said, but a Black person cannot deny being Black. The Black person is therefore “forced into authenticity.”

    Fanon wrote as a psychiatrist. He argued that conditions of racism and colonialism produced pathologies.

And, as I sat listening, I began to sense a deep and organic relation here in Bandung between race and religion, two of the most powerful and irrational forces in human nature … [A] racial consciousness, evoked by the attitudes and practices of the West, had slowly blended with a defensive religious feeling; here, in Bandung, the two had combined into one: a racial and religious system of identification manifesting itself in an emotional nationalism which was now leaping state boundaries and melting and merging, one into the other.

    People with African ancestry produced a different kind of cultural good because people with African ancestry experience the world differently. Senghor attributed this to what he called the “physio-psychology of the Negro.” 158 The Negro had a particular way of being in the world, and it produced “another way of knowing,” which he defined in opposition to white ways of knowing. “White reason is analytic through utilisation,” he said; “Negro reason is intuitive through participation.” 159 African thought is animistic: it sees objects as the expressions of a life force. Africanist culture reflects the African person: it is emotional, intuitive, holistic, and empathic. Négritude, therefore, extends throughout the diaspora, because it travels with the race.

    For Fanon, the notion of a coherent Negro African culture within colonized territories was a mirage. He agreed with Césaire that colonization was culturally destructive, and deliberately so. “The undertaking of de-culturisation shows itself as the negative side of a more gigantic work of economic, and even biological, enslavement,” he said. But the practice was even more nefarious, because the indigenous culture was not simply obliterated: “the end sought is the sustained death agony rather than the complete disappearance of the pre-existing culture. This culture, formerly full of life, and open to the future, becomes closed, fossilised in the colonial status, caught in the yoke of oppression.” 169 Native culture persists, mummified.

The professional does not pursue the work from self-interest—to promote a nonscholarly agenda or to make money. The professional academic’s dedication is to knowledge, and knowledge production is what the institution rewards. 18 Academic freedom is designed to insulate scholars and researchers from political interference, and the standard of disinterestedness is, in effect, the pledge of the nonpolitical nature of academic inquiry.

The home was figured as a kind of haven requiring someone’s full-time commitment. 1 But a Cold War explanation doesn’t make complete sense.
