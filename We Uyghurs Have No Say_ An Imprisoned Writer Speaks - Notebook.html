    The Uyghur homeland has been known by various names over the centuries—Xiyu, Moghulistan, Altishahr, Kashgaria, Little Bukharia, Eastern Turkestan—but today it falls within the borders of China’s “Xinjiang” administrative unit. This name, officially bestowed on the region in the late 1800s, gives a hint of how the Uyghurs came under Chinese rule; it is a Chinese word for “new territory.”

<div class="noteText">
    Whereas Stalin had saved the term “minority” for groups that were dispersed among larger populations (his model case was the Jews), the Communist Party of China labeled all nationalities under its control “minorities”—except, of course the Han. Within their historical homeland (strictly the southern half of Xinjiang), the Uyghurs are actually a numerical majority—what Stalin would have called simply a “nationality.” But when considered as part of the larger Chinese nation-state, they are vastly outnumbered by the Han, a power dynamic enshrined in official CCP ideology with the phrase “minority nationality.”

    Nonetheless, the theory of political rights for nationalities survived, and it was formalized in various constitutions and laws (often unenforced) over the course of the PRC’s history.

<div class="noteText">
    It is difficult to overstate the sensitivity of these issues within China. CCP laws and pronouncements describe a “nation-state of many nationalities” in which all nationalities are equal. CCP policy, by contrast, suggests a lack of confidence in these ideals, and the on-the-ground reality bears undeniable hallmarks of a colonial project.

    Xi ushered in two kinds of change that transformed the assimilationist push into the totalitarian ethnonationalist system Uyghurs endure today. The first was a sharp increase in coercive and extralegal measures to eliminate criticism of the Communist Party throughout China. Ilham is only one of its many casualties. The second was a surge in ethnonationalist justifications for CCP rule. The CCP presents itself as the savior of the nation as it always has, but now, more than at any point in the history of the People’s Republic, it portrays that nation as essentially Han.

    In the development of natural resources in ethnic areas, the state has not really thought about how local people are supposed to benefit; nor have they paid much attention to driving local economic development, in particular agricultural development; nor have they sought to transition local people from the countryside to new industries in urban centers for work.

    As part of our self-understanding as a people, the most important thing we need to do is carry out long-term resistance to totalitarian ideology and ethnonationalist chauvinism to prevent it from coming back and occupying our national ideology and political sphere. For an ethnonationalist girded by totalitarianism, minority peoples are in essence a “social blank space”—an open field in which social experiments can be conducted at will. This picture of a supposed “blank space” gives rise to all manner of fanciful, imagined possibilities.

    The first thing we need to be clear about is that Uyghur and Tibetan autonomy didn’t begin when the CCP took power. Over the long span of history, Xinjiang and Tibet were independent, semi-independent, or highly autonomous for the vast majority of the time. This is a historical fact! As long as you respected the people there and respected their right to autonomy, there was stability in Xinjiang and Tibet. If not, there were uprisings, riots, wars, and separatism.

    Of course, I don’t think that you can fundamentally solve these problems through modernizing the region; it could only help a bit to ease some of Uyghurs’ unhappiness over the rule of the CCP secretaries. This is because in these two regions, economic growth is always accompanied by a heavy influx of Han migrants. (Don’t forget that for a long time this sort of migration was a product of political mobilization, not spurred by industrialization, urbanization, or commercialization. Of course, the effect of these factors becomes more salient every day.)

    I encouraged more Uyghur students to pursue studies in sociology, law, economics, political science, anthropology, and other fields so that in making career choices they will be able to combine their personal goals with the progress of their ethnic group as well as their country.

    Since the 1990s, rapid marketization in Xinjiang has produced a great deal of economic development. Unequal development opportunities among ethnic groups have grown more apparent. Certain developments within Uyghur communities have been particularly worrying. Theft, pickpocketing, drug trafficking, drug abuse, and prostitution—vices against which a devoutly religious people as the Uyghurs are supposed to have natural resistance—have gotten so bad that our entire ethnic group is suddenly perceived as a crime-prone community. The Uyghurs have fallen mercilessly into the fate of the “Malthusian trap.”

    China is accustomed to the use of political solutions, especially those employing the use of political indoctrination.

    As ethnic issues in China become more sensitive and pressing, more and more studies are examining China’s ethnic policies from the perspective of combating separatism, drawing lessons from countries with failed ethnic policies.

    In addition, I made Uyghur Online a tool to influence and solicit Uyghurs’ ideas about society. In Uyghur society today, there are virtually no rational, moderate, and constructive voices that grapple with the real problems of Uyghur society, free of [China’s] official, orthodox, and constrained propaganda. From overseas there are no lack of provocative and subversive statements, which don’t solve any real problems. As Xinjiang faces the danger of escalating ethnic conflicts, and discussions of ethnic problems tend to be radical, I believe that one of our most important tasks is for us to use rational and constructive voices to compete against more extreme ones in the marketplace of ideas, moving social sentiments in a more positive direction.

    When people are unable to attain the knowledge essential in a modern society, unable to cultivate strength of character for modern life, and cannot acquire healthy modern societal values such as rationality, tolerance, and open-mindedness, they may find themselves in crisis, consumed by fear that they are being increasingly abandoned by modern society. The rapid disintegration of traditional society and the challenges of adapting to a new environment can leave people mired in ignorance, parochialism, savagery, and despair.

    In 1997, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee’s “Document No. 7” marked a watershed moment in Xinjiang’s ethnic conflict: in it, the Party Central Committee expressed its belief that the biggest problem facing Xinjiang was the threat of the “three forces” [of terrorism, religious extremism, and separatism]. In Xinjiang, this new policy thrust resulted in a series of measures that soon transformed the entire Uyghur population into suspected separatists and precipitated a rapid decline in the status of Uyghur cadres and the responsibilities given to them.

    Although today’s Chinese Communist Party is a political party that transcends ethnic, class, and interest group boundaries, the consensus within Uyghur society can be summed up as follows: Han Chinese equal power, therefore power equals Han Chinese; Han Chinese equal the Communist Party, therefore the Communist Party equals Han Chinese. Uyghur officials account for a very small proportion of total government officials, and Uyghurs who occupy positions of real power—bureau-level cadres or higher—are even rarer. Some powerful governmental departments such as Finance, Public Security, and the SASAC [State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission] have virtually no Uyghur officials. The situation is even more glaring in Xinjiang’s state-owned enterprises: one would be hard-pressed to cite even a single example of a state-owned enterprise headed by a Uyghur. Whether in the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the National People’s Congress [NPC], or the Communist Party Congress, the number of Uyghur committee members and representatives is disproportionately low. Underrepresentation and low levels of political participation reflect the declining political status and increasing marginalization of Uyghurs in China.

    Naturally, nationalism is the business of a nation’s elite, and cadres and intellectuals represent a gathering of the national elite. Their ideas can sway the emotions of an entire community, giving expression to the interests of that community, while also serving as the voices of moderation and rationality. When cadres and intellectuals of the Uyghur elite find themselves increasingly constrained by narrower and narrower circumstances, their resentment, depression, and ethnic grievances cannot help but spread through the entire community.

    Today’s Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps [XPCC, or simply “the Corps”] is a most insular and unique organization. It is often informally described as “an army with no military budget; a government that pays taxes; a labor union made up of farmers; and a business that is a society of its own.”

    military role has all but disappeared, while its political role has been bolstered. The political functions of the Corps can be outlined as follows: (1) maintain social stability and deter separatism; (2) promote ethnic interaction and national unity; (3) effectively manage the continued existence and development of the Corps itself. Truly, only the first two functions have any value or inherent meaning. Yet judging by the current state of the Corps, those two functions have long since ceased to exist.

    If something were to happen in the present situation, it should be the People’s Armed Police that responds, rather than the XPCC militia. Taking the unusual step of mobilizing the Corps’ civilian militia would be politically inappropriate in the extreme: after all, why should Han Chinese civilians be given the responsibility, or even the right, to used armed force to suppress an uprising among Uyghurs?

    The current status of the Corps can be summarized as follows: On the political front, not only has the Corps lost its role as a deterrent against separatism, it has lost its political raison d’être. On the fiscal front, the Corps has become a financial burden to the government. On the social front, the Corps is facing a severe population drain. On the economic front, the Corps must contend with an increasingly impoverished constituency. On the legal front, the precise legal standing (or even the legality) of the Corps has never been adequately established. On the ethnic relations front, the Corps has become a symbol of ethnic antagonism. On the institutional front, the Corps is the last bastion of centralized economic planning in China—it has failed to implement even the “contract responsibility system,” a system of market-based economic reforms that have been in place in other areas of China for over three decades. On the status front, the Corps is an awkward amalgam of “party, military, government and private industry”: it is all of the above, and yet none of the above. Finally, on the local relations front, the Corps has never served its stated purpose of “clarifying and coordinating” relations with the local population.

    The Corps continues to exist as a highly complex and redundant bureaucracy, a society unto itself, an administrative unit possessing provincial-level powers, having every comparable entity except for the Congress of People’s Representative and the People’s Political Consultative Conference (although all of the Corps’ division-level farms and up have their own television stations), and serving as a vast support system for a large number of people.

    In southern Xinjiang in particular, Chinese cadres are very nearly regarded as “stand-ins” for all Han Chinese, representatives of an entire race of people.

    In addition, local governments in Xinjiang are tasked with providing jobs to demobilized military officers, which means that a large proportion of Xinjiang’s grassroots cadres are former military officers. Long years of indoctrination about being the “first line of defense,” combined with military working methods, has given rise to a unique governing style among Xinjiang’s lower-level cadres. Particularly in southern Xinjiang, where living and working conditions are difficult, grassroots cadres are selected primarily for their political qualifications and reliability.

    Although the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law was promulgated as a basic law nearly thirty years ago, there still are no regional-level regulations governing its implementation. The system of regional ethnic autonomy is a story of years of accumulated promises—promises that have, noticeably, not yet been honored. There are a variety of reasons why regional ethnic autonomy has never been truly implemented: cultural and economic factors, the unique political climate of the times, and other factors. The Uyghur community was never particularly vocal about this nonimplementation, partly because of a lack of awareness or knowledge about their basic rights, and partly because they never felt that their legitimate rights and interests had been seriously undermined.

    Chinese scholars frequently regard Yugoslavia as a case study in secessionism, but few people draw the correct lesson: although the separatist tendencies of ethnic peoples in Yugoslavia were far less serious than in Spain, the dominant ethnic group, the Serbs, cared less about the nation’s territorial integrity than they did about competing with other ethnic groups for a bigger slice of the national pie. Fanatical Serbian nationalism played a destructive role in Yugoslavia’s dissolution.

    Some Han people have gone on an online crusade against Uyghurs as a people. That kind of attitude is extremely dangerous. Han people have a certain degree of freedom of expression, but Uyghurs don’t. That’s a serious problem. For example, many people are attacking Uyghurs online, and there’s a great deal of ethnic discrimination. No matter whether you look at it from an academic perspective, from a human rights perspective, or from the view of the West, it’s ethnic discrimination. Han people need to reflect more on their own nationalist and fascist attitudes. Over the past twenty years, Han people—especially the younger generation—have grown up drinking the wolf’s milk of nationalism. They are very emotional and angry, and their chauvinism is quite serious. To put it bluntly, some in Han society have turned fascist against us. There are already “skin-heads” targeting Uyghurs. This kind of thinking, these emotions—it’s very dangerous. The reality is that China is ruled by the Han. So they should bear some responsibility for this country and for our fate. You’re the ones who have made us integrate. You’re leading us, and as leaders you must take responsibility and be inclusive and tolerant. If 1.3 billion Han cannot tolerate 10 million Uyghurs, then how can you talk about unity or harmony?

    With its secular forces under pressure, Uyghur society is becoming increasingly closed-off and isolated. As a result, it’s the more negative and closed-minded forces that are driving Uyghur society now. We once had our own perfectly good system of clothing, culinary culture, and music. Why are these now all becoming increasingly Islamicized? It’s because ordinary people have lost all hope in their government, in society, in Uyghur intellectuals, and in secularism. The government was first to destroy the forces of secularism. These should have been most able to interact with Han society and the government, but the government destroyed them instead. So Uyghur society has moved in a completely different direction and become distorted.

Chinese scholars, however—whether official scholars or not—have simply not picked up on this trend. That is to say, they have not grasped the changes in the social fabric of Uyghur society. They just look at GDP, not the problems behind GDP.

    Yes. But now they have a feeling of having been thwarted, a sense of failure. This isn’t merely a rural problem—it goes for intellectuals, cadres, students; it’s across social strata.

    It seems on the surface that what the authorities fear most is separatism, but my view is that they’re perfectly clear about their ability to deal with that. The fact is that separatism is just not a strong force in Xinjiang, and there is no real organization advocating it. Perhaps what the authorities fear instead is the Uyghur people having their own ethnic and cultural identity. This is a collective identity of a people, and when the suppression becomes a collective sentiment, of course the authorities get scared. Why don’t they fear the Han common folk? Because they don’t have a feeling of collective suffering. Each individual feels that things are unequal or unreasonable, but they don’t share that sense collectively. But Uyghurs, due to their common belief, have a sense of themselves as a people, and this collective identity is growing stronger.

    There will always be discrimination between groups—it exists in France and in America. But the nation and the government itself must stand for what is right. The basis for this is the law, morality, and local history. But the authorities have precisely neglected all these questions in Xinjiang—they’ve simply considered a few short-term policies, then concealed or misrepresented what they’re really about.

    When incidents happen, the authorities simply want to crush, repress, crack down—high pressure on top of pressure—and it creates a vicious spiral. High pressure in Xinjiang simply leads to a heightened backlash. If this continues, resistance will become a culture—it won’t be an isolated incident of resistance, or problems in just one village, but the entire people will develop a “resistance culture.”

    Currently the male-female sex ratio is severely unbalanced. This is not only a problem for demographers—many people have come to recognize it. Uyghur females outnumber males, and many Uyghur girls are unable to marry.
