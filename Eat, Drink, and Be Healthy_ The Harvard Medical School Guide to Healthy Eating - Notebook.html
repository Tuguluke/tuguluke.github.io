    • Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, but limit fruit juices and corn, and hold the potatoes. • Eat more good fats (these mostly come from plants) and fewer bad fats (these mostly come from meat and dairy foods). • Eat more whole-grain carbohydrates and fewer refined-grain carbohydrates. • Choose healthy sources of protein, limit your consumption of red meat, and don’t eat processed meat. • Drink more water. Coffee and tea are okay; sugar-sweetened soda and other beverages aren’t. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • Take a multivitamin for insurance, just in case you aren’t getting the vitamins and minerals you need from the foods you eat. Make sure it delivers at least 1,000 international units of vitamin D.

    • Go for whole grains—about one-quarter of your plate. Intact and whole grains, such as whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains (see chapter six). • Choose healthy protein packages—about one-quarter of your plate. Fish, chicken, beans, soybeans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources. Limit red meat, and try to stay away from processed meats such as bacon and sausage (see chapter seven). • Use healthy plant oils, such as olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, and peanut, in moderation. Stay away from foods containing partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy artificial trans fats (see “Trans fats,” page 83). If you like the taste of butter or coconut oil, use them when their flavor is important but not as primary dietary fats. Keep in mind that low-fat does not mean healthy (see chapter five). • Drink water, coffee, or tea. Skip sugary drinks. If you enjoy milk, don’t have more than two glasses a day (see chapter nine). If you drink alcohol, keep it moderate—no more than two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women. • Exercise. It’s good for overall health and controlling weight.

    More than two thousand years ago, Greek physician and philosopher Hippocrates made diet (and exercise) the centerpiece of good health and the basis for treating disease. Here’s just one of his recommendations that sounds familiar today: Suitable vegetables, cooked or raw, must be eaten in abundance. Fast-forward fifteen hundred years and the human life span was increasing. Soon after the invention of the printing press in the mid-1400s, Bartolomeo Platina’s De honesta voluptate et valetudine (On Honorable Pleasure and Health) became a bestseller throughout Europe. Aiming to combine health with the pleasure of eating, it melded medical advice with recipes taken from other published works. 1 In the 1860s a low-carb diet devised by London undertaker William Banting2 became so wildly successful that the term “Banting” was used for years in Europe

    These flip-flops are so confusing and so common that a negative report on vitamin E and beta-carotene once goaded Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman to write, “There seems to be some sort of planned obsolescence now to medical news. Today’s cure is tomorrow’s poison pellet. Fresh research has a sell-by date that is shorter than the one on the cereal box.”

    The Women’s Health Initiative—which tested the effect of reducing dietary fat to 20 percent of calories and increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables on the development of breast cancer, heart disease, and other chronic conditions among almost 60,000 women in the 1990s—cost more than $ 2 billion and didn’t yield clear answers on this important question, in part because there was actually very little difference in fat intake between women assigned to follow a low-fat diet and those following the comparison “usual diet.”

    Case-Control Studies In this type of study, researchers gather information from a group of people who have developed a particular disease (the cases) and a similar group of people who are free of that disease (the controls). They then compare the two groups for differences in diet, exercise, or whatever variable they are interested in. Case-control studies are effective tools when the variable is clear-cut—say, cigarette smoking or occupation. They don’t work as well for diet, when only small differences are likely to be seen from person to person. Case-control studies are also more prone to error and bias than cohort studies.

    A systematic review combs through the medical literature to identify all the relevant studies and then offers conclusions based on them. A meta-analysis statistically combines the published results from a systematic review to provide an overall “bottom line.” One problem with meta-analyses is that they gather data only from published studies and so can’t capture information from “negative” studies, which tend not to get published. Another is that almost anyone with a computer and Internet connection can do a meta-analysis. But to be done well for a complicated topic like diet and health, deep knowledge of the topic is also required. For example, investigators who conducted a headline-grabbing meta-analysis concluding that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat had no benefit for heart disease risk7 were clearly unfamiliar with the published literature, the design of the studies they included, and even the definition of the dietary variables that they used.

    Possible beneficial effects of alcohol have been suspected for more than two thousand years. In the late 1700s, William Heberden, the British physician who first described the chest pain known today as angina, wrote that “wine and spiritous liquors—afford considerable relief from angina.” 8 Sporadic reports appeared throughout the twentieth century suggesting that drinking alcohol prevented clogged arteries, but they were often balanced by reports of the detrimental effects of heavy drinking. Since 1974, though, dozens of case-control and cohort studies from different geographic regions with different alcoholic beverages have shown that people who have one or two alcoholic drinks a day are less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease than nondrinkers or heavy drinkers. 9 This relation persists even after the results have been statistically adjusted for smoking, exercise, and other variables that could differ between drinkers and nondrinkers. These observations have been further bolstered by evidence from laboratory, animal, and controlled feeding studies in humans showing that alcohol increases levels of protective HDL cholesterol and also makes blood less likely to clot, both of which would be expected to protect against heart disease. Using a Mendelian randomization approach, a genetic variant involved in metabolizing alcohol was shown to be associated with heart attack risk, and only in those consuming alcohol.

    Given the flood of information from nutrition research, I suggest that you not make big changes in what or how you eat based on a single study. If a result is on the right track, other studies will show the same thing. And it won’t matter much in the long run whether you make a change today (like taking a vitamin or increasing the amount of monounsaturated fat in your diet) or six months from now.

    Fat that accumulates around the waist and chest (often called abdominal adiposity) may pose more of a health problem than fat around the hips and thighs. Abdominal fat has been linked with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and heart disease. This fat, especially the fat inside the abdomen, may be generating more hormones and other chemicals that affect health than fat stored elsewhere.

    Measuring your waist can be useful because many people—particularly men—find themselves converting muscle to abdominal fat as they go through midlife. Even though weight may remain stable, an expanding waistline can be a warning sign of trouble on the horizon. So use your waist as a kind of low-tech biofeedback device—a waist-wise expansion of two or three inches over the years should trigger a warning that you need to reevaluate your diet and physical activity level.

    It’s likely that our prehistoric ancestors shaped our physiological and behavioral responses to food. Early humans routinely coped with feast-or-famine conditions. Since it was impossible to predict when the next good meal might appear—like a patch of ripe berries or a catchable antelope—eating as much as possible whenever food was available might have been a key to surviving the lean times. This survival adaptation means that complex chemical interactions between body and mind that evolved eons ago in response to routine periods of starvation may drive us to eat whenever possible. In this era of plenty, that means all the time.

U.S. farmers produce about 4,000 calories’ worth of food a day for every man, woman, and child in America. 14 That’s nearly double what the average person needs. The almost inevitable consequence of this surfeit is a system that encourages full-tilt consumption. Producers and food manufacturers want us to eat more of their products, and they are competing with one another to exploit our weaknesses. The food industry spends billions

The keen senses we have inherited for salt and sweetness that were once needed for survival (our taste for sweet things, for example, helped early humans sort through leaves to find the tender young ones with a ready supply of energy) are continually exploited. The sugar and salt content of products have been ratcheted up to increase our expectations for sweetness and saltiness and get us to eat—and buy—more.

    We eat food for two physiological reasons: to get energy and to get chemical building blocks. The amount of energy a particular food can deliver to mitochondria—the tiny engines that power your cells—is measured in calories. Technically, a food calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a liter of water (just over a quart) from 14.5 ° C to 15.5 ° C. Practically, a food calorie is about the amount of energy a 150-pound person burns each minute while sleeping.

    This calorie blindness is the result of a neat solution to a vexing problem faced by some of earth’s early inhabitants: how to run a body on different fuels. Instead of having completely different intracellular systems for fats, carbohydrates, protein, alcohol, and the like, the cells in your body use one of two energy sources: glucose and fat. Much of what you eat is (or can be if needed) converted to the energy coin of the realm, a six-carbon sugar called glucose. When you eat, some of the glucose dumped into your bloodstream is used immediately by your cells. Some is linked into long chains, called glycogen, and stored in your muscles and

If glucose is like cash in your pocket, ready to be spent when needed, glycogen is money in the bank, available with a bit of effort, and fat is money tied up in stocks or mutual funds. However, the conversion of glucose to fat is a one-way street: fat can’t be converted back to glucose. So while your cells typically run on glucose, when there isn’t enough, you can switch over to burning fats, either directly from the fat you eat or by withdrawing fat from storage in your body. Brain cells are an exception: they run on glucose only.

    How is it that overweight and obese individuals aren’t able to draw from their stored calories when they are hungry instead of eating more? Ludwig offers evidence that a higher insulin level, stimulated mainly by eating rapidly digested and absorbed carbohydrates, is a key metabolic signal that shunts calories into storage as fat and keeps those calories locked up and inaccessible.

    Several popular diet books claim foods that deliver relatively few calories per mouthful, like soup or baked squash, fill you up faster than foods that pack more calories, like meat or nuts, and so help you lose weight. This concept is called energy density. Apples, potatoes, cooked rice, and lettuce have low energy densities, largely because they are mostly water. Nuts, bagels, cookies, Wasa bread, and other dry, high-fiber foods have high energy densities.

    Your body depends on fats for a host of functions. They are a major energy source for cells. They make up body fat (adipose tissue), which stores energy, cushions and protects vital organs, and provides insulation. Many people think of cholesterol as a fat, but it isn’t, because it is made up of rings of carbon and hydrogen atoms, not simple chains (see “Types of Fat” on page 76). The body doesn’t break down cholesterol for energy but instead uses it to make cell membranes, the critically important sheaths around nerves. It is also a building block from which the body makes vitamin D and many hormones.

    Fats provide the raw materials for building cell membranes, the delicate yet sturdy skin that surrounds cells and controls what gets in and what gets out. Fats make up the sheaths that surround and protect nerves. They provide raw materials that the body uses to make hormones and the chemicals that control blood clotting and muscle contraction. The human body can build most of the different fats it needs from any other fat in the diet. If your body needs more of one type of monounsaturated fat for a specific function, it can make it out of saturated fat. It can also build fat from carbohydrates. However, a few fats can’t be made from scratch. Called essential fats, these must come directly

    Cholesterol moves through the bloodstream packaged in tiny particles called lipoproteins. The three key types, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), have the biggest effects on heart health. LDL is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol. When there are too many LDL particles in circulation, they can build up inside of artery walls. This narrowing of the artery, called atherosclerosis, makes it difficult for blood to flow through the vessel. These cholesterol-laden buildups, called plaque, set the stage for heart attacks and strokes. In contrast, HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol. These particles sponge up cholesterol from the bloodstream, the lining of blood vessels, LDL and VLDL particles, and elsewhere. They carry it to the liver for disposal. HDL also helps the liver recycle other lipoprotein particles. Triglycerides make up most of the fat that you eat and most of the fat that circulates in your bloodstream. Triglycerides are essential for good health, since your tissues rely on them for energy. But, as is the case for cholesterol, too many triglycerides in circulation may be bad for the arteries and the heart.

Spikes in blood sugar and insulin place a constant and heavy demand on the pancreas to make more insulin.

Simple carbohydrates provide us with energy and little else. Complex carbohydrates are more . . . well, complex. In essence they are long chains of linked sugars. There are many types of complex carbohydrates in our food. The main one is starch, a long chain of glucose molecules.

    Some popular diet books warn against eating carrots because they were initially found to have a high glycemic index. Even if they do, carrots are mostly water, with only a small amount of carbohydrate. Finally, it’s important to consider the other nutrients in a food. For example, the glycemic load of most commercial whole wheat bread is only slightly lower than for white bread because the starch is pulverized into fine particles in both products. But the whole wheat bread is a better choice because it delivers fiber and other nutrients that are removed from the white bread. Best of all would be a coarsely ground whole-grain bread that would also have a lower glycemic index.

    How much the food has been processed. Grinding wheat into superfine flour dramatically increases the attack rate of digestive enzymes. Not only does flour have greater surface area than coarsely ground wheat grains, it has been stripped of the protective, hard-to-digest, fibrous outer coat that temporarily fends off enzymes from digesting the starch inside. Regular oatmeal, which is made of smashed oat grains, has a higher glycemic index than oats that are intact or sliced, usually sold as steel-cut oats. Instant oatmeal has an even higher glycemic index.

    The milling process first cracks the wheat grains. The starchy, carbohydrate-rich center, called endosperm, is separated from both the dark, fibrous bran and the wheat embryo, called the wheat germ. The endosperm is then pulverized with a series of rollers to make white, powdery flour. If the wheat grain is milled into fine flour without removing the bran and germ, this is technically a whole-grain product, since all the original parts are still present. But it is no longer an intact whole grain.

    Your hair and skin are mostly protein. Ditto your muscles, the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in your blood, and the multitude of enzymes that keep you alive and active. In fact, your body is home to at least 10,000 different proteins. Together they make up about 15 percent of your weight. On the molecular level, proteins are long, intricate chains fashioned from just twenty or so basic building blocks called amino acids. Because our bodies are constantly making new proteins, and because we don’t store amino acids, we need a near daily supply of protein. Some proteins in food are complete, or “high quality.” That means they contain all of the twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more essential amino acids; those are the ones we can’t make from scratch or from other amino acids. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods tend to be good sources of complete proteins, while proteins from plants are often incomplete. That’s why vegetarians need to eat combinations that complement each other, such as rice and beans, peanut butter and bread, and tofu and brown rice.

(A dramatic increase in milk consumption has contributed to the rapid increase in height among Japanese boys and girls.) Socially, being taller may be a good thing. But it has been linked to increased risks of several types of cancer, including lymphoma and breast, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancers. 1 Later in life, many people lose muscle, which increases the risk of falling and breaking a bone. This happens partly due to lack of exercise and partly due to the falloff in growth hormone production. A growth-promoting boost from high-quality protein at this stage in life may be helpful.

Consuming too much kale—hard to do when eating the vegetable but easy to do when drinking kale smoothies—can cause the thyroid gland to slow its production of thyroid hormone. This condition, known as hypothyroidism, can cause symptoms that range from fatigue and increased sensitivity to cold to weight gain, muscle aches and stiffness, thinning hair, depression, and memory loss. It’s best to eat fruits and vegetables the way they grow, not concentrated into juice and smoothies.

    Many factors influence bone remodeling. Putting a bone under repeated stress, like the stress of lifting a weight or carrying a body at a trot, triggers growth. Lack of stress, like sitting all day, leads to degeneration. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone stimulate bone-building activity. The chaotic rush of these hormones during puberty sets off an adolescent’s growth spurt. Their loss later in life—a gradual ebbing away in men, a more abrupt cessation in women—nudges the balance toward bone loss, a shift that can be sudden and dramatic in women. The amount of calcium available to bone-building cells, called osteoblasts, also influences bone remodeling, as do the amounts of vitamins A, D, and K. But as I will describe shortly, exactly how much calcium you need each day is a very open question.

You don’t need more than that. Keep in mind that many foods are now fortified with calcium, including breakfast cereals, orange juice, soy milk, and more. These can easily send your calcium intake above 2,000 milligrams a day. That isn’t good: the National Academy of Medicine has set that as the upper limit for anyone over age fifty. In addition, there are four things almost everyone can do to reduce the chances of developing osteoporosis and fractures: • Be as physically active as possible. Engage in a variety of activities to keep your bones healthy and your muscles strong. • Take 800 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D a day. Many multivitamin brands contain this much. • Get enough vitamin K. You can do this by eating at least one serving of green leafy vegetables a day. • Don’t get too much extra preformed vitamin A (retinol) unless prescribed by your doctor. Keep your daily dose from supplements under 2,000 IU.

    There’s a smattering of evidence that a little extra vitamin C, about the amount found in a typical multivitamin, at the very beginning of a cold might relieve some symptoms, but there’s no support for megadoses. Prevent cancer and heart disease? The evidence is thin and most studies don’t support that. It’s possible that some extra vitamin C might help prevent cataract formation, but here again more research is needed. Recommended intake: The current recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C is 75 milligrams a day for women and 90 milligrams a day for men, with an extra 35 milligrams a day for smokers. As the evidence continues to unfold, I suggest getting 200 to 300 milligrams of vitamin C a day. This is easy to do with a good diet and a standard multivitamin pill. Good food sources: Good food sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits and juices, berries, green and red peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and spinach. Many breakfast cereals are also fortified with vitamin C.

    Vitamin D isn’t exactly a vitamin. Instead it is a hormone made by a rather unusual gland: your skin. Sunlight striking the skin turns a cousin of cholesterol into pre–vitamin D. This is first processed by the liver and then activated by the kidneys or by cells in the heart, immune system, breast, or prostate.

    The darker your skin color, the less effectively your body converts sunlight to vitamin D. In a national survey of Americans, black men and women had about half the vitamin D in their blood as their white counterparts. The gradual loss of skin pigmentation as humans migrated northward from the so-called cradle of mankind in Africa was probably an evolutionary adaptation to capture more vitamin D from less sunlight.

Other good food sources of calcium include sardines, tofu, canned salmon, turnip greens and kale, and fortified soymilk or orange juice. If you feel that you aren’t getting enough calcium in your diet and want to get more, try a calcium supplement.

    There are two types of iron in food. Heme iron, which travels around the bloodstream in the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin, comes from red meat, poultry, and fish. Non-heme iron comes from fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and other plants. The body absorbs heme iron more easily than it absorbs non-heme iron, even when we already have enough iron aboard. People who need extra iron are often advised to eat lean red meat. Meat is certainly a great source of this mineral, but it is also high in calories, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Another drawback is that your body doesn’t regulate the absorption of iron from meat as carefully as it does from grains, fruits, vegetables, and supplements.

    whole grains, particularly if milled, can lose their freshness and become rancid if stored at room temperature too long. Keeping them in the refrigerator or freezer will greatly lengthen their shelf life. Fats and Oils Stock your pantry with olive oil plus one or more of the following: canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, and peanut oil. Use these oils to sauté vegetables, to stir-fry fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings. At the table, try dipping bread into olive oil or drizzling oil onto the bread instead of using butter or margarine. Protein The best choices for protein are beans, nuts, tofu and other soy foods, fish, chicken, or turkey. Balance them with plenty of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats. Other Essentials Have on hand high-quality basics like extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh and dried herbs, plus different types of nuts. Along with the essentials above, you’ll have what you need to build virtually any healthy recipe.
