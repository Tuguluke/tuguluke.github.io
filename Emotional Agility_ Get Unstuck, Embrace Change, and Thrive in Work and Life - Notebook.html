    One recent study found the effect of multitasking on people’s performance was actually comparable to driving drunk. Other studies show that low-grade daily stress (from the lunch box that needs to be filled at the last minute, the cell phone battery that dies right as you need to get on a critical conference call, the train that’s always running late, the looming pile of bills) can prematurely age brain cells by as much as a decade.

    Trying to correct troubling thoughts and feelings leads us to obsess unproductively on them. Trying to smother them can lead to a range of ills from busywork to any number of self-soothing addictions. And trying to change them from negative to positive is an almost surefire way to feel worse.

<div class="noteText">
    Emotional agility is a process that allows you to be in the moment, changing or maintaining your behaviors to live in ways that align with your intentions and values. The process isn’t about ignoring difficult emotions and thoughts. It’s about holding those emotions and thoughts loosely, facing them courageously and compassionately, and then moving past them to make big things happen in your life.

<div class="noteText">
    During the average day, most of us speak around sixteen thousand words. But our thoughts—our internal voices—produce thousands more. This voice of consciousness is a silent but tireless chatterbox, secretly barraging us with observations, comments, and analyses without pause.

    because the angular gyrus, the brain region in which this judgment occurs, sits at the crossroads of our touch, hearing, and vision centers.

    let’s say there are seven basic emotions: joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, contempt, and disgust.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 43 · Location 538

<div class="noteText">

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 49 · Location 620
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    But brooders are ahead of bottlers in one respect: In their attempt to solve their problems, brooders are at least “feeling their feelings”—meaning, aware of their emotions.

<div class="noteText">
    In psychology, just as there is System 1 and System 2 thinking, there are also Type 1 and Type 2 thoughts. Type 1 thoughts are the normal human anxieties that come up as you tackle life’s everyday obstacles: the big project at work, the crazy schedule, last night’s fight, parenting concerns. Type 1 thoughts are straightforward: “I’m worried about X” or “I’m sad about Y.” Type 2 thoughts happen when you enter the mental house of mirrors and start to layer in unhelpful thoughts about the thoughts. “I worry that I worry so much” or “I’m stressed about being stressed.” To our troubling emotions we add guilt for having them. “Not only am I worried about X or sad about Y, but also I have no right to be.” We’re angry at our anger, worried about our worry, unhappy about our unhappiness. It’s like quicksand. The harder you struggle with your emotions, the deeper you sink.

    The paradox of happiness is that deliberately striving for it is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of happiness itself. Real happiness comes through activities you engage in for their own sake rather than for some extrinsic reason, even when the reason is something as seemingly benevolent as the desire to be happy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Page 58 · Location 748

<div class="noteText">
    In North America, happiness tends to be defined in terms of personal accomplishment (including pleasure); whereas in East Asia, happiness is associated with social harmony. Chinese Americans prefer contentment, while Americans with European backgrounds prefer excitement. Japanese culture is built around loyalty, with its connection to guilt, whereas American culture embodies more socially disengaged emotions such as pride or anger. To be happy within a given culture depends more than a little on how in sync your feelings are with that culture’s definition of happiness.

<div class="noteText">
    Other “bad” emotions are useful for different reasons. Embarrassment and guilt can serve important social functions in fostering appeasement and furthering cooperation. Sadness is a signal to ourselves that something is wrong—often that we are looking for a better way to be here and participate. And outward expressions of sadness signal to others that we could use some help. Suppress the sadness under a veil of false cheer and you deny yourself the directional guidance, and maybe also the helping hand.

<div class="noteText">
    As you may recall, when we ran through the list of common, everyday scenarios of being “hooked,” there was always an option C. That approach is neither bottling nor brooding but rather being present and having an open heart to all your emotions in a curious and accepting manner.

    I often advise my clients that a good way to become more accepting and compassionate toward yourself is to look back at the child you once were. After all, you didn’t get to choose your parents, your economic circumstances, your personality, or your body type. Recognizing you had to play the hand you were dealt is often the first step toward showing yourself more warmth, kindness, and forgiveness. You did the best you could under the circumstances. And you survived.

    wrong. It’s no fun, but like all our emotions, it has its purpose. In fact, society depends on guilty feelings to keep us from repeating our errors and misdeeds. A lack of guilt is actually one of the defining features of a sociopath. While guilt is focused on the specific misdeed, shame is a very different animal. Linked to the feeling of disgust, shame focuses on a person’s character. Shame casts one not as a human being who did a bad thing, but as a human being who is bad. This is why people who are shameful often feel diminished and worthless.

    PENNEBAKER’S WRITING RULES Set a timer for twenty minutes. Open up your notebook, or create a new document on your computer. When the timer starts, begin writing about your emotional experiences from the past week, month, or year. Don’t worry about punctuation, sloppiness, or coherence. Simply go wherever your mind takes you, curiously and without judgment. Write just for yourself and not for some eventual reader. Do this for a few days. Then, throw the paper away (or stick it in a bottle and cast it out to sea), or close the document without saving it. Or if you’re ready, start a blog or find a literary agent. It doesn’t matter. The point is that those thoughts are now out of you and on the page. You have begun the process of “stepping out” from your experience to gain perspective on it.

    On the other side of the ledger, it’s mindfulness that allows you to notice your uncomfortable feelings and thoughts rather than be entangled in them. When you’re mindful of your anger, you can observe it with greater sensitivity, focus, and emotional clarity, perhaps discovering where the anger is actually coming from.

<div class="noteText">
    WAYS TO BECOME MORE MINDFUL BEGIN WITH THE BREATH For a full minute, do nothing but focus on your breath. Start by breathing in and out slowly, counting to four as you inhale, and counting to four as you exhale. Naturally, your mind will try to wander. Notice that, and then just let it be. Don’t berate yourself for “not being good at this.” Each time a thought pops into your head, just try to bring your focus back to your breath. That’s the whole game. It’s not about winning. It’s about engaging in the process. MINDFULLY OBSERVE Pick an object in your immediate environment—a flower, an insect, your big toe—and focus on it for one minute. Really look at it and try to see it as if you’ve just arrived from Mars and are seeing this thing for the very first time. Try to isolate and identify its various aspects and dimensions. Focus on the color, the texture, any movement it makes, and so on. REWORK A ROUTINE Pick something you do every day and take for granted, like making coffee or brushing your teeth. The next time you do it, focus on each step and action, each element of sight and sound and texture and smell. Be fully aware. REALLY LISTEN Select a piece of music such as quiet jazz or classical and really tune in—use headphones if you can—as if you’d grown up in a cave and this was the first music you’d ever heard. Don’t judge it: Just try to identify different aspects of rhythm, melody, and structure.

    TECHNIQUES FOR STEPPING OUT 1. Think process. See yourself as being in it for the long haul and on a path of continuous growth. Absolutist statements drawn from old stories (“ I’m bad at public speaking” or “I suck at sports”) are just those—stories. They are not your destiny. 2. Get contradictory. In Zen Buddhism it’s common practice to contemplate paradoxes such as “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” There are probably paradoxes from your own life that you could chew on in a Zenlike fashion: You may love and loathe your hometown, your family, or your body. You can feel that you’re both the victim and the person responsible for a relationship breakdown. Embracing and accepting these seeming contradictions improves your tolerance for uncertainty. 3. Have a laugh. Humor can be a stepping-out practice because it forces you to see new possibilities. As long as you aren’t using humor to mask genuine pain (bottling), finding something funny about yourself or your circumstances can help you accept and then create distance from it. 4. Change your point of view. Try to consider your problem from the perspective of someone else—your dentist, perhaps, your child, or even your dog. 5. Call it out. Anytime you get hooked, identify that thought for what it is (a thought) and that emotion for what it is (an emotion). You can do this by introducing the language “I’m having the thought that . . .” or “I am having the emotion that . . .” Remember you have no obligation to accept your thoughts’ or emotions’ opinions, much less act on their advice. (This, by the way, is my go-to stepping-out hack. It’s easy to do on the fly or when you’re in the midst of a difficult interaction.) 6. Talk to yourself in the third person. As in the LeBron James example, this strategy allows you to transcend your egocentric viewpoint and regulate your reaction.

    But these writers were creating what’s called continuity of self.

    First off, I don’t think that inflexible notions of right and wrong help us much. And they certainly don’t belong in a book about emotional agility! Instead, I see values not as rules that are supposed to govern us, but as qualities of purposeful action that we can bring to many aspects of life. Values aren’t universal; what’s “right” for one person may well not be for someone else. But identifying what matters to you, whether that’s career success, creativity, close relationships, honesty, altruism—there is an almost infinite list to choose from—gives you a priceless source of continuity. Values serve as a kind of psychological keel to keep you steady.

    Here are some other characteristics of values: They are freely chosen and have not been imposed on you. They are not goals; that is, they are ongoing rather than fixed. They guide you rather than constrain you. They are active, not static. They allow you to get closer to the way you want to live your life. They bring you freedom from social comparisons. They foster self-acceptance, which is crucial to mental health.

    Twenty-five hundred years ago, Plato captured this inner conflict with his metaphor of a chariot being pulled by two very different horses. One horse was passion—our internal urges and yearnings—and the other, intellect: our rational, moral mind.

    It turns out Plato wasn’t too far off the mark. Modern neuroimaging tells us that whenever the impulsive, reward-seeking system in our brain (passion) conflicts with our rational, long-standing goals (intellect), our brain tries to—pardon the pun—rein things in.

You busy yourself with small tasks without considering the bigger picture. You become apathetic. You volunteer for only the least difficult assignments or tasks. You make backhanded comments about coworkers or projects. You rely on assumptions or stereotypes about your colleagues. You aren’t taking agency over your own career development.

    When I ask parents what their biggest wish is for their children, most say, “I just want them to be happy.” To be truly happy, though, one must know simply how to “be,” and by that I mean to be effectively with oneself—centered, kind, curious, and not fragile—in a changing world.

    —Those of us in the “real” world may not be able to tap ourselves with a magic wand and instantly transform ourselves into the people we most long to be. But if we practice emotional agility, we don’t need magic. Because emotional agility allows us to be our authentic selves for everyone, every day. Emotional agility is the absence of pretense and performance, which gives your actions greater power because they emanate from your core values and core strength, something solid and genuine and real. We reach that level of REAL, that level of emotional agility, not through magic, but through a series of tiny steps in everyday moments over the course of a lifetime. Here’s how you can start this journey today: —Appoint yourself the agent of your own life and take ownership of your own development, career, creative spirit, work, and connections. —Accept your full self—rubbed-off nose, shabby ears, “good” and “bad” emotions, the whole package—with compassion, courage, and curiosity. —Welcome your inner experiences, breathe into them, and learn their contours without racing for the exit. —Embrace an evolving identity and release narratives that no longer serve you. —Let go of unrealistic dead people’s goals by accepting that being alive means sometimes getting hurt, failing, being stressed, and making mistakes. —Free yourself from pursuing perfection so you can enjoy the process of loving and living. —Open yourself up to the love that will come with hurt and the hurt that will come with love; and to the success that will come with failure and the failure that will come with success. —Abandon the idea of being fearless, and instead walk directly into your fears, with your values as your guide, toward what matters to you. Courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking. —Choose courage over comfort by vitally engaging with new opportunities to learn and grow, rather than passively resigning yourself to your circumstances. —Recognize that life’s beauty is inseparable from its fragility. We’re young, until we’re not. We’re healthy, until we’re not. We’re with those we love, until we’re not. —Learn how to hear the heartbeat of your own why. —And finally, remember to “dance if you can.”
