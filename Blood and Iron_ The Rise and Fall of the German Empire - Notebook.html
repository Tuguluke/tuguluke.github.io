    As historian Neil MacGregor has shown in his epic account of German cultural history, the experience of the Napoleonic Wars was matched in unifying power only by the horrors of the Thirty Years’ War 200 years earlier. A spirit of defensive nationalism had taken hold that would lead to both the creation and the destruction of the German Empire.

    As both of the two leading nations at Vienna, Britain and Austria, agreed on this point, a decision was made against the Prussian model. A German Confederation, the Deutscher Bund, was set up.

    Napoleon had needed to be able to control the German lands he had conquered and thus cajoled, threatened, bribed and beat the smaller German states into the so-called Confederation of the Rhine, which consisted of thirty-six states in 1808 and excluded only Austria, Prussia and their vassal states. The Bund replicated this loosely and encompassed thirty-nine German states in its finalised form. This seemed a step forward from the hundreds of administrative units of the crumbling Holy Roman Empire, but the problem was that it had almost as little centralisation of power. Its only federal organ, the Bundesversammlung, was in effect a regular congress of diplomats rather than a parliament with legislative power over the states.

    One example was the creation of Burschenschaften, nationalist student fraternities at German universities. The University of Jena was (and still is) the spiritual home of these societies. The Urburschenschaft, Germany’s first such organisation, was founded there in 1815 and adopted the black-red-gold banner as their colours.

    Nationalist writers like Ernst Moritz Arndt also became central to the unification movement. His song, ‘Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?’, practically acted as a national anthem.

<div class="noteText">
    It is tempting to dismiss this as trivial, but the psychological role of shared cultural childhood experiences can hardly be underestimated. Combined with the powerful bond created by the sacrifices of the Liberation Wars, the Grimms’ linguistic and cultural influence added to a growing sense of Volk –the idea of a German people.

    It was later followed by heroic depictions of Germania, a female personification of national identity, who is usually shown strong, broad-shouldered and battle-ready. By contrast, the French Marianne tends to be painted in a more feminine form that emphasises liberty and beauty rather than defiance and bravery. Romanticism, liberalism and nationalism went hand in hand.

    Economically Prussia made huge gains in the lands it had been given in 1815 along the River Rhine. The Ruhr coalfield alone is one of the largest in the world, and there were further coal reserves near Aachen and in the Saar region.

    Economic coordination was not just desirable but essential. As help from Austria could not be expected, Prussia pressed ahead independently and set up a customs union, the Zollverein, in 1984.

    The tricolour of the revolutions was to be its flag and the ‘Deutschlandlied’ its anthem. Hoffmann von Fallersleben’s song, in particular, had considerable influence. Ironically sung to the melody of Joseph Haydn’s hymn to Francis II, Emperor of the Austrian Empire, the lyrics called on Germans to value their fatherland ‘above everything in the world’. Then, this phrase meant that the particularism that had stood in the way of German unity for too long should be left behind. The aggressive reinterpretation of the Nazis nearly 100 years later would make this verse unacceptable to successive German governments. The national anthem is now the third verse of the ‘Deutschlandlied’, beginning with the liberal values of the 1848 revolution, ‘Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit’ –unity, justice and freedom.

<div class="noteText">
    But 1848 also revealed and intensified a lot of the issues that would divide Germans and haunt their future Empire long after it was formally unified. Marx’s Communist Manifesto may not have looked like much physically –a thin, flimsy and grey booklet that had been produced on the cheap –but the ideas in it would have profound effects on Germany, Europe and the world. Socialist and communist thought would be a powerful driver of working-class movements and an ideology to scare the elites and the middle classes into panicked overreaction. It helped create a class consciousness that would match the existing regional, cultural and religious divisions in creating fault lines and strife. Both Bismarck and Wilhelm would fear the spectre of communism that was supposedly haunting Germany and Europe, and both sought to control it by perpetually feeding the defensive nationalism that had proved so effective through the first half of the nineteenth century.

    He argued revolutions and high moral principle would never lead to actual change, and a more realistic and pragmatic approach was the way forward. It is then not without irony that the arch-conservative Bismarck, who fought tooth and nail against liberalism, would go down in history as the archetype of a realpolitiker.

    Prussia also declared the German Confederation null and void, ending Austrian hegemony over the German lands once and for all. Formed as a military alliance in 1866, the North German Confederation was to be Prussia’s vehicle for the expansion of its power into the newly annexed states. The twenty-two members all sat north of the River Main.

    After Sedan and successive military victories from September 1870, an intoxicating wave of nationalist sentiment swept through the German lands. Bismarck used this temporary goodwill to bring the leaders of the states together for negotiations about a federal German nation state. In November, the southern German states joined the North German Confederation, and it was agreed that the new union should be renamed as the German Empire (Deutsches Reich).

    The entire set-up revealed much about the nature of the newly founded German Empire. It seems an odd choice to hold the official proclamation of a new nation on foreign soil. However, Bismarck knew that any location in the German lands would have risked raising one state above the others, compromising the fragile moment of unity.

    Bismarck, the Kaiser and the princes all appeared in uniform and celebrated the foundation of a nation state with soldiers and officers –not a civilian in sight. This was a far cry from the democratic unification of which the liberals had dreamed. At Versailles, there were no reminders of 1848 –no tricolour, no ‘Deutschlandlied’. Just marching bands and formalities in the heart of a humiliated enemy. Bismarck was right; the German Empire had not been made with speeches and majority decisions; it had been forged in blood and iron.

    but from the mid-nineteenth century onwards it was time to catch up. First through the Zollverein, then the North German Confederation and lastly the newly unified Empire, there had been more and more economic cooperation in the German lands, leading to what economic historians have dubbed the Second Industrial Revolution. Germany was naturally suited to industrialisation in a way that no other European country was. The geographical conditions are ideal. With access to the sea in the north, direct borders with many European neighbours, large and deep rivers like the Rhine, Danube, Elbe, Oder and Spree criss-crossing the land and flat plains ideal for railway tracks throughout the north, the only thing that hindered an efficient infrastructure and trade network was the lack of coordination between the German states up to 1871. In addition, Germany has vast resources of iron ore, coal and minerals alongside fertile agricultural land that provided enough food to sustain immense population growth. United, it was now the biggest European state in terms of both landmass and people and therefore had the potential to develop the largest economy.

    The compulsory military service of two years at a formative age had a transformative impact on a very young population. It created a sense of national belonging in men regardless of class, religious affiliation or political views that would last a lifetime and spill over into the next generation.

    Marx had already predicted years earlier that the insatiable need for profit in industrialised nations would lead to structural economic problems, and at the turn of the century, many believed that he was right. The rapid population growth from 41 million in 1871 to 65 million in 1910 combined with the increasing mechanising in production lines that made unskilled labour a mass phenomenon meant that supply of work was a commodity that could be turned on and off by industrialists as needed.

    Even supposedly lesser naval nations such as Italy and the USA had significantly larger fleets than Germany in the 1890s. This had to change. From 1898 a major programme of naval expansion rolled into gear. Under the leadership of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, Germany embarked on a fateful course of Flottenpolitik.

    The idea was that Germany would not be able to rival Britain’s naval power in the immediate future, and Britain, in turn, would not freely accept German naval expansion. So the solution was to build up sea power sufficient to be too risky to attack. Tirpitz proposed that this risk factor would be reached at two-thirds of the British naval force, which would then pressure Britain to forge an alliance with Germany rather than oppose it.

    The concepts of survival, struggle and competition in the natural world, which Charles Darwin had popularised in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, also published as The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, began to be seen as a universal law that applied to humans as much as plants and animals. In this Social Darwinist world, where only the strongest and fittest survived, nation states and their peoples were pitted against each other in a perpetual struggle for resources, space and ultimately survival. This intermingling of the concepts of nation, people and race found its conceptual outlet in the word völkisch, which self-appointed linguistic hygienists such as Hermann von Pfister-Schwaighusen even suggested as a replacement for the word ‘national’ as the latter had its origins in Latin, not German. The völkisch movement then began to identify each nation on ethnic and racial grounds, not linguistic and cultural ones as the liberals had. The Anglo-German philosopher Houston Stewart Chamberlain formalised the ideological foundation for this in his hugely influential 1899 book, The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century. He stressed the continuation of Ancient Greek and Roman sophistication in the modern Western and particularly Germanic populations of Europe: Certain anthropologists would fain teach us that all races are equally gifted; we point to history and answer: that is a lie! The races of mankind are markedly different in the nature and also in the extent of their gifts, and the Germanic races belong to the most highly gifted group, the group usually termed Aryan […] Physically and mentally the Aryans are pre-eminent among all peoples; for that reason they are by right […] the lords of the world.XXX If nations are thus defined on ethno-racial grounds, minorities become at best parasites, at worst enemies.

    This went hand in hand with the traditions of the Turnbewegung, a gymnastics movement dominated by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, an early German nationalist and educator. Both saw a strong connection between physicality and nationhood, which found an ideal outlet in militarism and the defence of the fatherland.

    Educational reforms had produced an enviable literacy rate of 99 per cent, one of the highest in the world, which meant that even the poorest wage worker could find some literary relief after a long shift. The proportion of the population that can be described as avid readers rose from an estimated 5 per cent to 30 per cent between 1850 and 1900.

    Most Germans shared a love for order, discipline and the military. The latter combined strongly with a romanticised vision of camaraderie, loyalty and adventure, which found its outlets in the pulp fiction of Karl May and the high culture of Wagner. Concepts of struggle, fraternity and foes created a powerful bond between elites and workers, who were otherwise so bitterly opposed.

    The situation looked bleak. Splitting its forces, due to the obstacles of the Masurian lakes, the Russians attacked with 191,000 soldiers from the north and 200,000 from the south, while only 153,000 Germans stood against them. The situation would lead to the meteoric rise of two Prussian generals: Paul von Hindenburg and Erich von Ludendorff, who were barely known outside of military circles until this moment. The Battle of Tannenberg, which raged from 26 to 29 August, was a seemingly miraculous victory for the German army. The second Russian army was obliterated. Its commanding general, Samsonov, committed suicide and 45,000 Russians were captured. Hindenburg and Ludendorff became living legends. In the German psyche, this battle would remain a saving grace within the bleak and humiliating experience of the First World War.

    To this day, the term Juliusturm is used to refer to surplus state funds (which has not happened since the 1950s). The Reichskriegsschatz was thus ideal propaganda material to reassure the Reichstag and the informed German public that there was a financial cushion. In reality, the coins only amounted to 120 million marks in 1914. The economic historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler estimated that the direct costs for the war amounted to 100 million per day.XIX The glorious war chest would therefore not even have paid for two days of fighting.

    As this ‘hunger blockade’ was at least in part aimed at the civilian population, it constituted a breach of international law that was even criticised by neutral nations such as the USA, where German Americans were outraged and demanded action. In addition, the blockade brought a serious disruption of the cotton trade, angering the business lobby in America, who saw no reason to take sides in a European war if it meant economic pain. The sinking of the Lusitania and the unrestricted submarine warfare conducted by the German navy quickly changed such reservations.

    In total, nearly 2 million Germans would die on the front lines. Of all young German men who were between 19 and 22 when war broke out in 1914, a staggering 35 per cent would not be alive four years later when the war ended. This ‘lost generation’ left a gaping hole in families, communities and German society generally, and the fact that they had sacrificed their lives in vain created a collective sense of resentment and embitterment that would haunt Germany for years to come. In contrast to the glorification of the war dead in France, Great Britain and the USA, where the fallen were celebrated as war heroes who had sacrificed themselves for a greater good, German families had no such solace. They were told that they were wrong to follow the Kaiser into war, to send their sons, brothers and husbands into a doomed, imperialist venture.

    In August 1914, German soldiers were still sent out with the iconic spiked helmet, the pickelhaube. They not only made the wearer an eye-catching target in the context of trench warfare, but they were also made from leather and thus completely useless against bullets and shrapnel. In 1915, the war machine began to run out of leather and substitute helmets were made from starched felt or even paper, something that only changed in 1916 when steel helmets were slowly rolled out. In any case, all helmets left the jaw area, mouth, nose and eyes completely exposed. An exploding shell would fling red-hot pieces of metal through the air at terrible speed. Soldiers who were hit and survived were often left with ruined faces. Skin and bone grafts were not yet widely available and the best that could be done for these men was painted tin masks that would cover the gaping holes where there was once a jaw or teeth or a nose. Eating and drinking was often only possible with great difficulty, and many died of infection months or even years later. Those who survived would be shunned. Fervent patriotism began to turn into anger and resentment.

    The German Empire did not fall to visions of democracy or socialism. Neither was it brought down by the German people or the Allies. The system fell because it was flawed from the outset, built on foundations of war, not fraternity. The maintenance of national unity required a diet of conflict, the constant hunger for which grew until catastrophe loomed in 1914. The German Empire had come full circle. It ended where it had started: in blood and iron.
