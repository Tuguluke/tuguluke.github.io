    A tradition that goes back to Galileo and Descartes recognized the most fundamental feature of language, which then got its most explicit articulation in Humboldt: “Language is quite peculiarly confronted by an unending and truly boundless domain, the essence of all that can be thought. It must therefore make infinite employment of finite means, and is able to do so, through the power which produces identity of language and thought.” 1 Darwin, too, is cited as repeating this in a more elementary form in the context of evolutionary concerns about language: “The lower animals differ from man solely in his almost infinitely larger power of associating together the most diversified sounds and ideas.” It is worth noting that there are three fundamental features observed here by Humboldt and Darwin. First, the claim to an infinite power residing in a finite base; second, the link of ideas with sound; and third, the link of language with thought. All of them are gathered in what Chomsky declares at the outset as the Basic Property of language: “[ E] ach language provides an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions that receive interpretations at two interfaces, sensorimotor for externalization and conceptual-intentional for mental processes.” The hierarchical-structural element speaks to the first feature; the sensorimotor interface, to the second feature; and the conceptual-intentional interface, to the third feature.

    That follows, in turn, from the very natural assumption that I-languages are generative systems based on the most elementary computational operation, which is order-free.

    What is language? Indeed, as he says, there is reason to think that most of language/ thought is not externalized at all. If one firmly understands that language is not designed by human beings but is part of their biological endowment, then, taking language as an object of study, whether scientific or philosophical, there might have to be considerable shift in our methodological approaches.

    that language emerged not gradually, but suddenly (and relatively recently). Such a sudden “great leap forward,” it may now be speculated, was perhaps caused by a “slight rewiring of the brain [that] yielded Merge, naturally in its simplest form, providing the basis for unbounded and creative thought,” hitherto unpossessed.

    Chomsky points out that with Newton, a new framework emerged in which—by the lights of those limits—something inconceivable was being proposed. Newton himself admitted to this inconceivability, even calling it an absurdity, and nobody since Newton has done anything to redeem things on just this score.

    Just because what we study, the world, may not be ultimately intelligible, does not mean that we should be inhibited from striving to produce intelligible scientific theories of the world. Even the concept of free human action, Chomsky says, which may go beyond any of the concepts we possess (crucially, determinacy and randomness) may one day be scientifically tractable, though we are far from anything like that understanding at present. This is quite different from the attitude of Kant, who declared freedom to be thinkable but never knowable.

    This latter understanding of democracy, of course, dominates the practice of societies and governments in much of the Western world, and Chomsky is keen to point out that even at its worst, it never lets up on the claim to be pursuing high-sounding ideals of the common good, showing how the common good is universal in a quite paradoxical way: it is preached as applying to all, even as it is everywhere violated by those who are said to be representing all but who mostly pursue the interests of a few.

    Galileo wondered at the “sublimity of mind” of the person who “dreamed of finding means to communicate his deepest thoughts to any other person… by the different arrangements of twenty characters upon a page,” an achievement “surpassing all stupendous inventions,” even those of “a Michelangelo, a Raphael, or a Titian.”

    If this line of reasoning is generally correct, then there is good reason to return to a traditional conception of language as “an instrument of thought,” and to revise Aristotle’s dictum accordingly; language is not sound with meaning but meaning with sound—more generally, with some form of externalization, typically sound though other modalities are readily available:

    The discovery of perturbations in the orbit of Uranus did not lead to the abandonment of Newton’s principles and Kepler’s laws, or to the broader conclusion that there are no physical laws, but to the postulation—later discovery—of another planet, Neptune. Exceptions to largely valid descriptive generalizations play a similar role quite generally in the sciences and have done so repeatedly in the study of language.

    A fair guess today—and one that opens rich avenues of research and inquiry—is that some slight rewiring of the brain yielded Merge, naturally in its simplest form, providing the basis for unbounded and creative thought, the “great leap forward” revealed in the archaeological record, and the remarkable differences separating modern humans from their predecessors and the rest of the animal kingdom. Insofar as the surmise is sustainable, we would have an answer to questions about apparent optimal design of language: that is what would be expected under the postulated circumstances, with no selectional or other pressures operating, so the emerging system should just follow laws of nature, in this case the principles of Minimal Computation—rather the way a snowflake forms.

    Take, for example, the digestive system. Vertebrates have “a second brain,” the “gut brain,” the enteric nervous system, “an independent site of neural integration and processing.” Its structure and component cells are “more akin to those of the brain than to those of any other peripheral organ.” There are more nerve cells in the bowel than in the spine, in fact more “than in the entire remainder of our peripheral nervous system,” 100 million in the small intestine alone. The gut brain is also a “vast chemical warehouse within which is represented every one of the classes of neurotransmitter found in the brain,” with internal communication that is “rich and brain-like in its complexity.” The gut is “the only organ that contains an intrinsic nervous system that is able to mediate reflexes in the complete absence of input from the brain or spinal cord.” “The brain in the bowel has evolved in pace with the brain in the head.” It has become “a vibrant, modern data-processing center that enables us to accomplish some very important and unpleasant tasks with no mental effort,” and when we are lucky, to do so “efficiently and outside our consciousness.” It is possible that it “may also have its own psychoneuroses,” and some researchers today report that it is susceptible to such diseases of the brain as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and autism. It has its own sensory transducers and regulatory apparatus, which equip it to deal with specific tasks imposed by the organs with which it interacts, excluding others.

    Comparable concerns are considered to pose serious dilemmas for the study of the first brain and its capacities, human language specifically. This seems to me one instance of a curious tendency to treat mental aspects of the human organism differently from so-called physical aspects, a kind of methodological dualism, which is more pernicious than Cartesian metaphysical dualism. The latter was a respectable scientific hypothesis, proven wrong when Newton undermined the mechanical philosophy of early modern science by demonstrating that one of the Cartesian substances—body—does not exist, thereby eliminating the mind-body problem, at least in its Cartesian form, and leaving open the question what the “physical” or “material” is supposed to be.

    Though gravitation of matter to matter is “inconceivable to me,” nevertheless, as Newton demonstrated, we must recognize that it is within God’s power “to put into bodies, powers and ways of operations, above what can be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we know of matter.” And thanks to Newton’s work, we know that “he has done so.”

    The phrase “we do not yet understand,” however, should strike a note of caution. We might recall Bertrand Russell’s observation in 1927 that chemical laws “cannot at present be reduced to physical laws,” a fact that led eminent scientists to regard chemistry as no more than a mode of computation that could predict experimental results but not real science. As soon discovered, Russell’s observation, though correct, was understated. Chemical laws were not in fact reducible to physical laws as physics was then understood, though after physics underwent radical changes, with the quantum-theoretic revolution, it was unified with a virtually unchanged chemistry.

    The Fifth Amendment to the American Constitution guarantees the rights of “persons”: crucially, that they shall not be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” provisions that trace back to Magna Carta. But the concept person was sharply circumscribed. It plainly did not include Native Americans or slaves. Or women. Under British common law, taken over by the colonies, women were basically property: of their father, handed over to their husbands. The prevailing concept was expressed by Kant a few years later: women have no “civil personality” because they depend for their living “on the offices of others,” like apprentices and servants, who also lack “civil personality.” The Fourteenth Amendment extended personhood to freed slaves, at least in principle. In reality, a few years later a North–South compact permitted the slaveholding states to reinstitute a form of slavery by effectively criminalizing black life, providing a cheap and disciplined labor force for much of the industrial revolution, a system that persisted until World War II created the need for free labor. The ugly history is being reenacted under the vicious “drug war” of the past generation, since Ronald Reagan. As for women, it was not until 1975 that the Supreme Court recognized women to be “peers,” with the guaranteed right to serve on federal juries—hence advancing to the category of full personhood. Recent court decisions extend the right of personhood that had already granted to corporations, while excluding undocumented aliens from the category. 28 It would be no great surprise if chimpanzees are granted the rights of persons before undocumented immigrants are. In brief, understanding “person” to be a forensic term has many complex and troublesome human consequences.

    Accordingly, Newton’s discoveries left the world unintelligible when his theological assumptions were dismissed. The solution reached, as mentioned earlier, was to lower the goals of science, abandoning the search for intelligibility of the world in favor of something much weaker: theories that are intelligible to us whether or not what they posit is intelligible. It was then quite natural for Bertrand Russell to dismiss the very idea of an intelligible world as “absurd,” no longer a reasonable goal for scientific inquiry.

    While the list of mysterians is long and distinguished, their stance appears to contrast with the exuberant thesis that the early scientific revolution and the Enlightenment provided humans with limitless explanatory power, exhibited in the rapid development of modern science. One outstanding figure who espoused this view was David Hilbert. In his final lecture in 1930, not long before the Nazi plague destroyed the Hilbert Circle in Göttingen, he recalled “the magnificent manner of thinking and of the world-view that shines forth” in the words of the great mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, who admonished Joseph Fourier for holding that the goal of mathematics was to explain natural phenomena. Rather, Hilbert urged, “the sole aim of all science is the honor of the human spirit,” and so “a problem of pure number theory is every bit as valuable as a problem with practical applications.” Whoever grasps this manner of thinking, Hilbert continued, will realize that “there is no ignorabimus,” either in mathematics or in natural science. “There are absolutely no unsolvable problems. Instead of the foolish ignorabimus our answer is on the contrary: We must know, We shall know”—words that were engraved on Hilbert’s tombstone.

He opens his Moral Sentiments by observing that “however selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” Despite the power of the “vile maxim of the masters of mankind”—“ All for ourselves, and nothing for other people”—the more benign “original passions of human nature” might compensate for that pathology.

    The terms of political discourse are hardly models of precision. Considering the way the terms are used, it is next to impossible to give meaningful answers to such questions as “what is socialism?” Or capitalism, or free markets, or others in common usage. That is even truer of the term “anarchism.” It has been subject to widely varied use, and outright abuse both by bitter enemies and those who hold its banner high, so much so that it resists any straightforward characterization.

    So understood, anarchism is the inheritor of the classical liberal ideas that emerged from the Enlightenment. It is part of a broader range of libertarian socialist thought and action that ranges from the left anti-Bolshevik Marxism of Anton Pannekoek, Karl Korsch, Paul Mattick, and others, to the anarcho-syndicalism that crucially includes the practical achievements of revolutionary Spain in 1936, reaching further to worker-owned enterprises spreading today in the Rust Belt of the United States, in northern Mexico, in Egypt, and in many other countries, most extensively in the Basque country in Spain, also encompassing the many cooperative movements around the world and a good part of feminist and civil and human rights initiatives. This broad tendency in human development seeks to identify structures of hierarchy, authority, and domination that constrain human development, and then to subject them to a very reasonable challenge: justify yourself. Demonstrate that you are legitimate, either in some special circumstances at a particular stage of society or in principle. And if they cannot meet that challenge, they should be dismantled. And not just dismantled but also reconstructed, and for anarchists, “refashioned from below,” as Nathan Schneider observes in a recent commentary on anarchism.

    Proceeding with the same thoughts, again quoting Rocker, anarchism “seeks to free labor from economic exploitation” and to free society from “ecclesiastical or political guardianship,” thereby opening the way to “an alliance of free groups of men and women based on cooperative labor and a planned administration of things in the interest of the community.” As an anarchist activist, Rocker goes on to call on popular organizations to create “not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself” within the present society, following Bakunin’s injunction.

    About 70 percent, at the lower end of the wealth/ income scale, have no influence on policy. As we move up the scale, influence slowly increases, and at the very top we reach those who pretty much determine policy, by means that are not obscure.

    Or perhaps, a little more kindly, it is what British legal scholar Conor Gearty calls “neo-democracy,” a partner of neoliberalism, a system in which liberty is enjoyed by the few and security in its fullest sense is available only to the elite, but within a system of more general formal rights. 12 It is a society that is free in the Hobbesian sense that a person “is not hindered to do what he has a will to do,” and “if I choose not to do something merely because I dread the consequences, this does not mean that I am not free to do it; it merely means that I do not want to, that is, I am still free,” so Hobbes explains. If the choice is starvation or servitude, and nothing hinders the choice, then we are free; it is merely that we do not choose starvation, dreading the consequences. In contrast, a truly democratic system would seek to achieve the Humboldtian ideal. It might well have the character of “an alliance of free groups of men and women based on cooperative labor and a planned administration of things in the interest of the community,” quoting Rocker again.

    But Dewey went well beyond calling for some form of public control. In a free and democratic society, he wrote, workers should be “the masters of their own industrial fate,” not tools rented by employers, nor directed by state authorities. That position traces back to leading ideas of classical liberalism articulated by Humboldt and Smith, among others, and extended in the anarchist tradition. Turning to education, Dewey held that it is “illiberal and immoral” to train children to work “not freely and intelligently, but for the sake of the work earned”—to achieve test scores for example—in which case their activity is “not free because not freely participated in.” To use imagery dating from the Enlightenment, education should not be a matter of pouring water into a vessel—and a very leaky vessel as we have all experienced—but rather, to borrow from von Humboldt again, it should be conceived as laying out a string along which learners proceed in their own ways, exercising and improving their creative capacities and imaginations, and experiencing the joy of discovery. Under these conceptions, in Dewey’s words, industry must be changed “from a feudalistic to a democratic social order,” and educational practice should be designed to encourage creativity, exploration, independence, cooperative work—much the opposite of what is happening today.

    The problem with democracy that Madison perceived had been recognized long before by Aristotle, in the first major work of political science: Politics. Reviewing a variety of political systems, he concluded that democracy was the best—or perhaps the least bad—but he recognized a flaw: the great mass of the poor could use their voting power to take the property of the rich, which would be unfair. Madison and Aristotle faced the same problem but selected opposite solutions: Aristotle advised reducing inequality, by what we would regard as welfare state measures; Madison felt that the answer was to reduce democracy.

    The essential nature of the conflict, which has far from ended, was captured simply by Thomas Jefferson in his last years, when he had serious concerns about the quality and fate of the democratic experiment. He distinguished between “aristocrats and democrats.” The aristocrats are “those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes.” The democrats, in contrast, “identify with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the honest & safe, altho’ not the most wise depository of the public interest.”

    THE TITLE FOR this chapter is drawn from Hume’s observations about the man he called “the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species,” Isaac Newton. In Hume’s judgment, Newton’s greatest achievement was that while he “seemed to draw the veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored [Nature’s] ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain.”

    In his classic introduction to quantum mechanics a few years later, Paul Dirac wrote that physical science no longer seeks to provide pictures of how the world works, that is, “a model functioning on essentially classical lines,” but only seeks to provide a “way of looking at the fundamental laws which makes their self-consistency obvious.”

    The model of intelligibility that reigned from Galileo through Newton and beyond has a corollary: when mechanism fails, understanding fails. The apparent inadequacies of mechanical explanation for cohesion, attraction, and other phenomena led Galileo finally to reject “the vain presumption of understanding everything.” Worse yet, “there is not a single effect in nature… such that the most ingenious theorist can arrive at a complete understanding of it.”

    I think he is also persuasive in interpreting the general Cartesian project as primarily “natural philosophy” (science), an attempt to press mechanical explanation to its limits; and in regarding the Meditations “not as the authoritative expression of Descartes’s philosophy, but as an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile his theologically suspect natural philosophy with an orthodox expression of scholastic metaphysics.” 25 In pursuing his natural science, Descartes tried to show that mechanical explanation reached very far but came to an impassable barrier in the face of such mental phenomena as the creative use of language. He therefore, quite properly, adopted the standard scientific procedure of seeking some new principles to account for such mental phenomena—a quest that lost one primary motivation when mechanical explanation was demonstrated to fail for everything.

    There has been very valuable work about how an organism executes a plan for integrated motor action—say, how a person reaches for a cup on the table.

    It is common to assert that “the mental is the neurophysiological at a higher level.” To entertain the idea makes sense, but for the present, only as a guide to inquiry, without much confidence about what “the neurophysiological” will prove to be. Similarly, it is premature to hold that “it is empirically evident that states of consciousness are the necessary consequence of neuronal activity.” Too little is understood about the functioning of the brain. 31 History also suggests caution. In early modern science, the nature of motion was the “hard problem.” “Springing or Elastic Motions” is the “hard rock in Philosophy,” Sir William Petty observed, proposing ideas resembling those soon developed much more richly by Newton.
