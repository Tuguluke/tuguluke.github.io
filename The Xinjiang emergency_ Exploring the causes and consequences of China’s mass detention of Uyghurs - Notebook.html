    This chapter undertakes two major tasks. First, it attempts to provide a conceptual entry-point into exploring the Xinjiang emergency. It does so by arguing that the trajectory of the party-state's governance of the XUAR has been profoundly shaped by dynamics of colonialism, settler colonialism, and associated state-building that have provided the bases for a transition towards cultural genocide in the XUAR as a means of resolving China's ‘Xinjiang problem’. Second, the chapter then provides an overview of the structure of and individual contributions to this volume.

    the intersection between concern for the ‘welfare’ of subject populations and the desire to eradicate ‘defective’ elements of Turkic Muslim cultural identities that is central to the ‘re-education’ system reveals that the objective of the party-state has transitioned to a fundamentally settler colonial one: the dissolution of autonomous Uyghur identity and its replacement by one subordinate to the Chinese state.

    argues that two core components of colonialism –the ‘exploitation of human resources and embedding of colonies in global economic structures’ and the ‘political and institutional differentiation of peoples in and from the center and the peripheries at the expense of the latter’ –were in fact ‘detectable only partially’ in the Qing Empire leaving the ‘one main aspect of colonialism’ consistent with the Qing experience being ‘a colonial discourse that includes tropes of othering and racism as well as a justification of colonialism as a mission civilisatrice’.

    Second, the retention of the region by the Qing for much of this time was ultimately ‘negotiable’ and based on strategic cost-benefit assessment as to its worth. ‘Since its conquest in the eighteenth century’, Laura Newby notes, ‘Xinjiang had been viewed as a bulwark of the empire's defences, control of which was arguably preferable to allowing it to fall prey to petty, squabbling tribes and polities, but ultimately negotiable’

    In the intervening years between the collapse of the Qing and the establishment of the PRC, Xinjiang experienced ‘warlord colonialism’ through which a succession of Han Chinese rulers sought to maintain their position of political and economic dominance over the majority Turkic Muslim populations of the region.

    in theory, was meant to ensure that under the leadership of the CCP the various minzu were to stand as equals, their individual culture, language, and practice of religion respected and protected (Bovingdon 2004). In practice, however, this was accompanied by tight political, social, and cultural control, encouragement of Han Chinese settlement, and state-led economic development, backed by the repression of overt manifestations of opposition and dissent by the security forces (Clarke 2011). This approach stimulated periodic and sometimes violent opposition from the Uyghur population (and other ethnic minorities), who bridled against its major consequences: demographic dilution, political and economic marginalization, and cycles of state interference in the practice of religion (Karrar 2018).

    For Hechter, the relationship of Britain's ‘Celtic fringe’ (i.e. Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) to the centre was defined by ‘hierarchical cultural divisions of labor’ that were established as the dominant culture fixed both an unequal distribution of power and resources and cultural boundaries between it and subordinate cultures. Such ‘internal colonialism’ was a deliberate strategy of domination by a ‘superordinate group [that] seeks to stabilize and monopolize its advantages through policies aiming at the institutionalization and perpetuation of the existing stratification’ (Hechter 1975: 39).

    Veracini (2015: 15) utilizes the metaphor of viruses and bacteria to illustrate the distinction between the two. Although viruses and bacteria, he notes, ‘are exogenous elements that often dominate their destination locales’, the former need ‘living cells to operate’ while the latter ‘attach to surfaces and may or may not rely on the organisms they encounter’. Colonizers and settler colonizers too are exogenous elements that dominate ‘destination locales’ but they fundamentally differ in the manner in which they do so: colonialism is ‘premised on the presence and subjugation of exploitable Others’ whereas settler colonizers ‘attach to land but generally do not need indigenous “Others” for their reproduction and operation’ (Veracini 2015: 15, 22). Taking the bacteria metaphor further Veracini notes: Bacteria also frequently secrete chemicals into their environment in order to transform it to their benefit. This can facilitate the acquisition of nutrients from the surrounding environment … Similarly settlers routinely and programmatically set out to reorganise the landscapes they encounter and deliberately promote the processes of systematic environmental transformation.

    ‘The primary objective of settler-colonization’, Patrick Wolfe remarks, ‘is the land itself rather than the surplus value to be derived from mixing native labour with it’ and as such the logic of settler colonial projects is ‘a sustained institutional tendency to eliminate the Indigenous population’ (Wolfe 1999: 163).

    For Lemkin, genocide has in fact two phases: ‘destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group’ and ‘the imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor’ (Lemkin 2008 [1944]).

    In the last years of the 1960s, there were ‘good’ Uyghurs who showed loyalty to the party. Today, there is arguably no acceptable way of being Uyghur in Xinjiang. Any Uyghur can be disappeared –even loyal CCP members. Additionally, in the CR nationality (or ethnicity) was not the basis for internment and persecution while the party and the government did not really control the repression that occurred during the CR.

    Finally, after the anti-local nationalism campaign in the XUAR ended, the CCP did not have to disavow its actions despite its disastrous consequences. Catris concludes by suggesting that a similar outcome may in fact take place with respect to the ‘re-education’ campaign: once the current leadership of the CCP concludes that ‘re-education’ has served its purposes there is little to suggest that it will face the consequences of even a symbolic reckoning with the injustices imposed on the Uyghur people.

    The campaign to eradicate ‘terrorism’ and ‘extremism’ in the region, which predates 2017, has taken on a life of its own. He concludes that it has been internalized by many state officials and citizens, who now view Uyghurs and related peoples as an existential threat to society and deserving of the violent policies that target them. In this sense, the PRC's ‘counterterrorism’ justification for its settler colonization of the Uyghur homeland mimics that of the ‘civilizing mission’ for European settler colonialism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

    They conclude that the CCP's pathologizing of Turkic Muslims is reflective of what James C. Scott (1998: 87–102) identified as ‘authoritarian high-modernism’, a utopian yet pernicious effort by the state to re-engineer society in its own image and create a perfect social order through science and technology, but one that actually leaves a wake of personal destruction in its path.

The less fortunate Burhan Shahidi who had been a bureaucrat in the Nationalist government of Xinjiang, however, would be beaten, humiliated, and imprisoned for about ten years.

    We know of similar attacks against religious sites in other parts of China, so it is plausible to believe that it happened in Xinjiang as well.

    mostly Uyghur intellectuals and cadres. Han cadres saw most Uyghurs and other Turkic persons with any social and political capital as untrustworthy and with little loyalty to the CCP. Regional authorities argued they allegedly harboured separatist desires. This reveals how early in the history of Communist-controlled Xinjiang these kinds of beliefs about Turkic intellectuals and cadres existed. In Xinjiang, the Anti-Rightist Campaign would turn quickly into an anti-local nationalism campaign that went on to affect local politics well into the Maoist period. The cadres leading the assault in the region blamed the continuing power of Uyghur nationalism on the party's earlier position against Han chauvinism and its gradual approach towards local traditions, which they found too lenient (McMillen 1979: 91–93). During the Anti-Rightist Campaign, many Uyghur and Turkic cadres were targeted and labelled counter-revolutionary because of their alleged separatism. The historian Zhe Wu –who had access to the XUAR archives –argues that Eziz Saypedin participated in a meeting of the Xinjiang Party Committee to resolve the issue of local nationalism on 16 December 1957. During this meeting, Saypedin allegedly argued that local nationalist tendencies presented the highest danger in the region (Wu 2015: 319).

    Before 1957, the overall position of the CCP in Xinjiang was that Han chauvinism represented the largest threat to stability in the region. After 1957, local nationalism and separatism would become the recurring issue in the region to this day. Authorities interpreted any criticism of Han chauvinism in Xinjiang but also any pride in Turkic culture, language, and the practice of Islam as evidence of local nationalism and separatism.

MacGregor and Bowles (2012: 437) have warned: ‘[ t] o prevent genocide, we have to understand its root causes. Genocide and mass killing do not simply erupt spontaneously. They are incremental processes, building blocks, which aggregate and develop into their final form.’

    He linked cultural genocide to the phenomenon of natural localness, that is, the cultural paradigm of the locale, which distinguishes difference or coherence depending on the individual. This phenomenon causes the individual or the group to be so inward focused that they become ignorant of those outside of the locale, manifesting in emotions of exclusiveness, often presenting as suspicion and dislike of outsiders (the Other). Therefore, natural localness is spurred on by a lack of critical thinking by a population and the inability of rational thought. Davidson further explained that due to the lack of domain knowledge necessary for critical thinking, a population becomes more reliant on experts to counteract their ignorance. However, the experts are themselves constrained by their own stereotypes and other agendas, so they use manipulation to stylize news of the world outside of the locale to suit their purposes. This can result in artificial views of whole communities of people, which can lead to a thought collective that can be ‘mobilised to act collectively against alleged enemies’ (Davidson 2012: 18).

    Instead, genocidal actors often pursue cultural genocide in its place as part of a gradualist approach. However, cultural genocide, warned Davidson, may signal intent for physical genocide so it should not occupy a lesser place when theorizing about genocide and genocidal intent. For Levine, analyses of genocide must recognize the existence of a ‘genocidal process’ that incorporates repressive state strategies targeting a perceived ‘problem’ population such as ‘marginalisation, forced assimilation, deportation and even massacre’ (Levine 1999: 342). Levine argued the UN Convention definition for genocide is inadequate due to its limited scope. 3 Citing Raphael Lemkin's more encompassing definition for genocide, he argued that the point of mass systematic annihilation (physical genocide) cannot be isolated from the years and decades of calculated events preceding the physical genocide. Moreover, Lemkin (2005 [1944]: 79) identified genocide as a coordinated plan intended to cause ‘the disintegration of the political and social institutions of the group’, and can include the ‘destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups’. This is the genocidal process, or creeping genocide, which may or may not result in a physical genocide occurring, depending on further choices made by the state. According

    Feierstein (2014: 67) identified ‘Genocide [a] s cold-blooded, rational policy, with social and political effects that go beyond the disappearance of the victims, no matter how many are killed’. His examination of the link between social policies as ‘reorganising genocide’ is significant to the XUAR as is his identification of social engineering and concentration camps as evidence of a genocide in progress. Campbell (2009: 150) also deliberately moves away from approaches to genocide that try to unpack the psychology of the act or equate the act with evil or madness, identifying that ‘most genocide is also social control’.

    Campbell believed social structure is the key factor in whether or not a conflict becomes genocidal. Therefore, while ethnic conflict might exist, it is how people define and respond to deviant behaviour from an ethnic Other that sets the parameters for the scale of violence. He identified explanatory variables such as immobility, the extent of cultural distance between the groups, relational distance, the degree of intermarriage between groups, functional independence of groups, and inequality as being key determinants for the likelihood and severity of genocide in a conflict. Further, he warned that ‘as states become more elevated in status –when they become more extensive –they become more violent’ with totalitarian regimes more violent than authoritarian ones, and authoritarian regimes more violent than democracies (Campbell 2009: 167). Therefore, according to Campbell, genocide arises when ‘conflict structures associated with extreme collective liability, extreme violence, organisation, and unilateralism’ are present, along with killing of the Other being regarded a moralistic and appropriate response to perceived deviant behaviour (Campbell 2009: 167).

    Further, they asserted that because uneven economic growth can worsen tensions, the implementation of economic policies requires careful planning and should aim to increase trust between different groups, reduce intergroup tensions and conflict, and produce a more prosperous and peaceful society for all.

I use this term as it appears in academic literature to describe the destruction of indigenous people in the context of settler colonialism (Davidson 2012; Altman 2018; Luck 2020). It is a term that is as much about territory as it is about people since its goal is to sever a deep bond between a given people and a territory, usually with the aim of mostly removing the people from that territory and breaking their group identity, way of life, and solidarity to prevent further resistance. This is not a legal term that is recognized by international law, and much of the literature on the topic bemoans this fact, but it also is not meant as a designation that precludes international courts from making a determination of ‘genocide’

Furthermore, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer acceptable to dehumanize people as ‘savages’ without access to civilization as was done to Native Americans, but it has become acceptable to dehumanize them, if they are Muslims, by labelling them as ‘terrorists’.

    it is important to note that the indigenous peoples of the Uyghur homeland were never as isolated as were the Native Americans from peoples and regions outside their homeland. The Uyghur homeland had long been at the crossroads of different empires historically. This situation made this region's incorporation into modern China especially contested, as it remained a battleground of geopolitics and a place where the indigenous peoples had substantial interaction with other peoples and states both before and after its absorption into modern China. It may also explain why the Chinese state must employ more draconian and blatantly violent tactics in the Uyghur homeland than even those employed by the United States against Native Americans.

Perhaps more importantly, by the late 1940s, the indigenous population of the region had entered into a model of shared governance with the modern Chinese state, suggesting a path forwards where the native peoples of the region could become a part of modern China on their own terms (Benson 1990: 97–109). The hope for such a decolonization of the relationship between the region's people and modern China was further extended during the first years of Communist rule after 1949. The CCP heavily recruited from the local population, particularly those who had been aligned with the pro-Soviet second ETR government and placed them in positions of importance in the government (McMillan 1979).

    Thus, when a wave of liberalism hit the region in the 1980s, an indigenous cultural renaissance took place as the indigenous population built mosques, schools returned to teaching the Uyghur language, and intellectuals and religious leaders were let out of prisons. At the time, the CCP even considered enhancing ethnic autonomy in regions like the XUAR, providing the indigenous peoples increased self-governance (Bovingdon 2010: 52–53).

    We have witnessed both Muslim-majority states using the GWOT to criminalize domestic political opponents as alleged ‘terrorists’ and countries with Muslim minorities using the GWOT to demonize entire ethnic groups as alleged ‘terrorists’. The PRC did the latter as it began to alter its approach to governing the XUAR after the US declaration of the GWOT. In doing so, the Chinese government would all but ensure that its settler colonization of the Uyghur homeland could involve large-scale cultural genocide with international impunity.

Today, it is assumed that we live in a postcolonial world where concepts of ‘savages’ and ‘civilized’ can no longer serve as justification for mass atrocities and social engineering. However, the framing of the cultural genocide in the Uyghur homeland as an effort at ‘counterterrorism’ and ‘countering extremism’ provides its implementation with a logic that is unique to the twenty-first century. It is a logic that recognizes alleged ‘terrorists’ as akin to the ‘savages’ of the nineteenth century, to which the norms of the civilized world do not apply.

This blanket characterization of these peoples allows for their wholesale dehumanization in the eyes of those implementing policies. As a result, it is understandable how the PRC has mobilized large numbers of functionaries and large swaths of the Chinese population to support policies that would be considered reprehensible if applied to others because these people are not considered fully human.

    Since 2012, Xi's Han-majoritarian assimilationist state has reconstructed the Uyghur body, mind, language, religion, and culture as a biological and existential threat to the Chinese nation: all Uyghur individuals are now assumed by default to be potentially disloyal subjects (Roberts 2018; Smith Finley 2019a). This framing of an entire people as a national security threat constitutes a political technology in a hegemonic project –a way for those in power to ‘manipulate the concept of security to pursue their goals’ (Lemon 2018: 1–2). In this case, the Chinese state has appropriated the lexicon of the ‘War on Terror’ as a means to label perceived Uyghur opposition as ‘religious extremism’ and thereby ‘generate diplomatic capital for the ongoing repression of Uyghur autonomist aspirations’ (Clarke 2018: 32).

    The world represents only so much culture and intellectual vigor as are created by its component national groups. Essentially the idea of a nation signifies … original contributions, based upon genuine traditions, genuine culture, and well-developed national psychology. The destruction of a nation, therefore, results in the loss of its future contribution to the world. (Lemkin [1944] 2005: 91) Lemkin considered genocide to be not necessarily the immediate destruction of a nation, but rather the more gradual eradication of ‘the essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves’ (Lemkin [1944] 2005:

    UN Convention on Genocide (1948) by the United Nations Secretariat had originally followed Lemkin's framework, defining genocide as any deliberate act committed with the intention of destroying the language, religion, or culture of a group, such as, for example, prohibiting the use of the group's language or its schools or places of worship. However, the final version of Article 2 of the Convention ended up being a much-reduced version, with no mention of linguistic, religious, or cultural destruction.

    In the late 1990s and 2000s, Uyghurs had increasingly tried to fashion their own independent connections with sympathetic cultures of the outside world –especially Turkey, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Moorish Spain –while bypassing Han China (Smith Finley 2013). 51 It is no coincidence, we argue, that these parts of the world, perceived as ‘backwards’, inferior, and potentially dangerous by the Chinese state, are wholly absent among the readings in this textbook series. Like the Uyghur homeland itself, they are invisibilized, ‘disappeared’. The dual message to Uyghur pupils is that the only possible way for them to interact with the outside world is as a loyal, assimilated member of the decidedly Han-majoritarian Chinese state, and that the only acceptable cross-border interactions are those with non-threatening, developed, secular nations that do not appear on the list of twenty-six ‘sensitive’ Muslim-majority countries published by Chinese authorities as part of their ongoing campaign of religious ‘de-extremification’.

    Looking through Lemkin's ([ 1944] 2005) lens, this is no less than genocide, because destroying the ‘essential foundations of the life’ of Uyghurs will ultimately end the existence of Uyghurs as a nation. The most recent reports about forced mass sterilizations and abortions among Uyghur women only confirm that the Han-majoritarian state has determined to speed up the earlier process of ‘cultural genocide’, which it may have deemed too slow.

    Biopolitics is a unifying term for the state's control and regulation of the vital characteristics of its population (Greenhalgh 2009). In the case of China it has been adopted as a lens through which to analyse the one-child policy (Greenhalgh and Winckler 2005), the hukou system (Ye et al. 2013), medical accidents (Cooper 2011a), and other intrusions of state imperatives on the biological lives of subjects. Organ harvesting is yet one more case that can be fruitfully seen through a biopolitical lens.

    The term biopolitics was coined by Michel Foucault. It was created to capture the modern shift in the logic of government whereby sovereign power begins to operate on the abstraction of the population, rather than over individuals alone. As ‘the population’ emerges as a political problem in its own right, new categories, metrics, and tools of surveillance and scientific manipulation arise: ‘the mortality rate has to be modified or lowered; life expectancy has to be increased; the birth rate has to be stimulated,’ and so on (Foucault 2003: 246). The term has now come to encompass substantially all state projects that seek to surveil and manage the biological aspects of human life.

    In a similar manner to Alexander Kojève's 1957 assessment of the Soviet Union as the only actually capitalist country (Kojève 2001: 118–119), the post-socialist phase of the last great Communist state of the PRC comes to fulfill Marx's own critiques of capitalism as a vampiric force (Marx 1867) that transforms life itself into ‘surplus’ to be capitalized (Cooper 2011b; Heinrich 2018: 6). The biopolitics of organ harvesting stands in contrast to the spectacle of ritual torture and execution of a failed regicide as depicted by Foucault (2012: 3–6): ‘Rather than staging its magnificence, violence conceals itself in shame’ (Han 2018:

This comports with publicly available research (Gautreaux and Freedman 2013; Mesnard et al. 2016).

    If theory is what the case lacks, then let us theorize. I wish to ‘de-fitishize’ organ harvesting by showing that the exploitative biopolitical logic that sustains it can be uncovered with reference to Marxian critique –an irony of the case, given that the perpetrators are themselves Communists. Marx's de-fetishizing critique was aimed to show that the supposedly natural character of the commodity form conceals the labour embedded in it. As a later gloss from a popular source put it, rather than the value of, say, a coat being inherent in the coat itself, ‘the coat's price comes from its history, the history of all the people involved in making it and selling it and all the particular relationships they had’ (Shawn 1997). The fetishism of commodities hides this background.

    In Marx's de-fetishizing critique, capital conceals the nature of commodities; in organ harvesting, the state turns its subjects into commodities. Because the relation it exposes between the state and the individual is so radical, we have failed to see its logic. If a chief aim of theory is to reduce surprise, this account of the CCP's predatory biopolitics suggests we should be unsurprised by the instrumentalization of PRC political subjects –whether as a slave labour force, or as raw biological products such as hair, plasma, marrow, fetuses, organs, or indeed entire cadavers.

    After the collapse of the neighbouring Soviet Union in 1991 the focus of Beijing's concerns regarding the security of Xinjiang shifted from state-based threats to largely non-state ones driven by the convergence of the Islamic revival in neighbouring Central Asia and Afghanistan and relative weakness of the post-Soviet states (Clarke 2007).

    However, it was the inter-ethnic violence in the region's capital or Urumqi on 5 July 2009 (referred to in China as the 7/ 5 Incident) that served as a major spur to crucial changes in the CCP's thinking about how best to secure its colonial project in Xinjiang (Millward 2009; Ryono and Galway 2015). The 7/ 5 Incident, in which officially 194 people were killed over two days of inter-ethnic violence, convinced influential leaders that the twin strategies of ‘national regional autonomy’ and state-led economic development upon which Chinese governance had rested since 1978 had exacerbated rather than assuaged long-standing sources of disgruntlement with the Chinese state.

Once the CCP had achieved power, it too instituted a system of extrajudicial ‘remoulding through labor’ (laogai) and ‘re-education through labor’ (laojiao) camps where the goal was to ‘transform’ the prisoner (usually defined as a ‘class enemy’) and achieve their ‘reform and rehabilitation’ (Fu 2005).

    The CCP responds by reinforcing the colonial geopolitical ordering it nominally resists by seeking to ‘surpass the West’ and eliminate non-Han identities. Uyghurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims are narrated as culturally empty barbarians attracted to Chinese civilization or as security threats but this identity–security framing is a conscious effort to assimilate in-between peoples who understand China's presence as colonialism. 41 The CCP's formal ethnic policy shift from nominal cultural pluralism towards racial assimilation (‘ fusion’) conceives China as a Han nation-state in global competition for power with other nation-states. However, fixing a plurality of identities as timelessly singular perpetuates anxiety and insecurity because identity is never singular or fixed, and will, therefore, require more state violence to eliminate identities in-between East and West.
