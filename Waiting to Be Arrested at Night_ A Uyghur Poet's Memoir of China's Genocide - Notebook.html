    For Uyghurs, poetry is not merely the province of writers and intellectuals. Verse is woven into daily life—dropped into conversation, shared constantly on social media, written between lovers. Through poetry, Uyghurs confront issues as a community, whether debating gender roles or defying state repression.

    His account combines a poet’s power of expression with a clear eye for the moral ambiguity found in even the most extreme circumstances. While the system of state terror in Xinjiang is orchestrated by an inhuman bureaucracy, the individuals running that system—and those crushed by that system—are human in full, and their complexity is present throughout Tahir’s narrative.

    The Chinese government’s war on its Uyghur minority is unprecedented, but the tools it employs are familiar. State repression in Xinjiang relies on weaponized social media, computer algorithms that monitor and predict behavior, and an array of high-tech surveillance technology, much of it developed in the West. Islamophobic discourses that gathered strength in the United States have been central to China’s efforts to justify its Xinjiang policies, while international corporations have been implicated in supply chains reaching back to forced labor in the Uyghur region.

    The government refused to acknowledge any potential causes for the violence in its own policies and in Uyghurs’ own lives. Among Uyghurs, though, all manner of accounts circulated about the origins of these attacks. For the most part, these accounts portrayed the authors of the attacks as having been victims of state injustice, bent on revenge. There were even those who believed that the government itself planned and carried out the violent incidents to provide a pretext for further repression, and to break Uyghurs’ will to resist.

    According to China’s constitution, the neighborhood committee (also known as the residents’ committee) was a local popular autonomous organ through which urban residents governed, trained, and served themselves; its chief, vice chief, and committee members were to be elected by residents.

    The woman operating the computer explained what I was to do. At the signal, I needed to look straight at the camera for two seconds, then turn my head slowly and steadily to the right. After two seconds in that position, I was then to turn at the same speed back to face the camera for another two seconds, then repeat the same motion to the left. At the same slow, steady speed, I then had to tilt my head back and look up for two seconds, after which I was to lower my head and look straight at the camera for two seconds, following which I had to tilt my head down and repeat the same motion. Finally, I had to look straight at the camera, slowly and completely open my mouth, and hold that position for two seconds. After I closed my mouth and looked steadily at the camera for a further two seconds, my facial scan would be complete. All of these movements needed to be completed in the assigned order in a single, uninterrupted sequence. If any movement did not conform to the requirements, the computer’s scanning program would give a signal and stop running, after which I would have to start over from the beginning. I successfully completed the sequence on my third try.

    Rumors began circulating, though, that the police had a special device that could detect hidden religious objects. The people who had hidden Islamic items grew terrified. The previous night, as soon as it grew dark, they began furtively tossing their religious articles down the manholes that led to the complex’s sewer system. To avoid tripping over each other, they hid in the buildings; when one person returned from tossing out their items, the next would run out, throw their items into the manhole, and run back inside. All of this happened quickly and surreptitiously, but because there were many people with items to throw out, it continued throughout the night. Some people sprinted out the door and stumbled into others, after which both would retreat to the building.

    After many years of political repression, Uyghurs were accustomed to using coded language. A political campaign was a “storm,” while innocent people caught up in mass arrests or in a Strike Hard Campaign were said to be “gone with the wind.” A “guest” at home often meant a state security agent. If someone had been arrested, they were “in the hospital”; the number of days they were to be in treatment marked the years of a prison sentence.

    Before we left, Munire asked us not to tell anyone what had happened. Usually there were two reasons for this. First, no matter the cause of an arrest, and regardless of whether it was just or unjust, people were extremely wary regarding those who had been detained. If one member of a family was arrested, especially for political reasons, those who caught wind of it would feel uneasy around that family or even avoid them. Second, in the event that the arrested person was soon released, the lid would stay on the pot and no one would know. It would be as if it had never happened.

    Since the mass arrests had begun, most detained Uyghurs had been summoned by phone to the local neighborhood committee or police station and then taken away. But some, especially intellectuals, had been taken from their homes in the middle of the night. From what I had heard, after midnight the police would knock on the door of the person they planned to arrest. As soon as the person opened the door the police would confirm their name, slap handcuffs on their wrists, and haul them off. They wouldn’t even let them change clothes; whatever they were wearing is what they would leave in. Some people had been taken away in their pajamas. Everyone knew what happened next. The police would take their prisoner to a jail cell or a camp lockup, where there was nothing besides a high ceiling, four thick walls, a camera in every corner, an iron door, and a chilly cement floor. If you felt hot you could remove clothes, but if you were cold there was nothing you could do. Even in high summer this was a practical problem one had to consider. If someone knocked at my door in the middle of the night, I planned to put on these warm clothes and autumn shoes before answering. Even though Kamil was arrested during the day, I had a strong feeling they would come for me at night.

    I looked carefully through the form. Employing the concision of Chinese characters to the fullest, the form was so crowded even the margins were in use. There were six sections: Basic Information, Movement Tracing, Religious Belief, Passport Holding Status, Stability Status, and License and Vehicle Status. Within each section was a series of small blanks, each more fateful than the next. It was clear that this form was targeted at Uyghurs. At the top of the upper right margin, under the heading “Labels of Interest,” five categories were packed vertically into a list: “person of interest,” “member of a special group,” “relative of individual in custody,” “relative of suppressed person,” and “marked in Integrated Joint Operations Platform.” Marks could be made in the brackets following each category. Below this, under the label “Key Information,” was a further vertical list of nine categories: “Uyghur,” “unemployed,” “possesses passport,” “prays daily,” “received religious education,” “has visited the twenty-six countries,” “excessive time abroad,” “possesses contacts abroad,” and “school dropout children in household.” Each category was likewise followed by a pair of brackets for marking.

All of them, though, spoke from the desperation of the powerless. Normally, it would be unimaginable for a Uyghur to say such a thing. I had seen Uyghurs who had married Han, Uyghurs with close Han friends, Uyghurs who looked down on their own people, and even self-hating Uyghurs, but before the mass internments I had never seen or even heard of a Uyghur who intended to shed their Uyghurness entirely and become Han.

    When we heard someone had been arrested, we would invariably ask what the reason had been. Each time we asked the question, though, we realized immediately how absurd it was. We knew perfectly well that the vast majority of the arrests were based on fabricated crimes. We all lived in fear, aware that we could be arrested at any time, on any pretext.

    “I wish the Chinese would just conquer the world,” one of my friends said suddenly. “Why do you say that?” asked one of our companions. “The world doesn’t care what happens to us,” my first friend replied. “The world doesn’t understand China. Since we can’t have freedom anyway, let the whole world taste subjugation. Then we would all be the same. We wouldn’t be alone in our suffering.” “It’s looking like you’ll get your wish,” said a third friend.

    According to my mother, the neighborhood committee had installed a camera by the front door of each apartment in her complex. The residents had to pay for the cameras; my parents turned in 280 yuan to the neighborhood committee to have a camera installed in front of their door.

    Two Uyghur youths, waiting on a bench in the middle of the lobby, stared with mouths agape when they saw me holding the passports. It was as if they had seen a ghost, so fearsome had passports become for Uyghurs.

    While waiting for them, I watched Han passengers pass through the conventional security check and hurry off to their gates. The security officials paid them no mind. This extra inspection is just for Uyghurs, I thought with renewed humiliation.

    My father and brother went to the national security unit headquarters. They told the officers that it was I who had called my mother; that in fact my parents had already made a clean break with me; that they had long ceased even considering me their son; and that in the future they would have absolutely no contact with me. After my father and brother signed a document guaranteeing all of this, they were able to recover my mother’s cell phone and ID card. I could hear the anger and disapproval in my brother’s voice. He finished his message by asking us not to contact them again.

    I usually discussed my dreams with Marhaba, who would tell me that the same fears haunted hers: police chasing her and taking her passport, her closest friends abandoning her. “Our bodies might be here,” she would say, “but our souls are still back home.”

    Since our arrival in America, I had often likened our family to an old tree forcibly transplanted from one patch of soil to another. Such a tree would produce roots only with difficulty, and might even waste away. Now Marhaba looked me in the eye. “Why can’t you see that this child is our old tree’s first root in this new soil?”

    I found myself thinking of the first lines of “Tarim River.” It was as if Perhat had written his own fate in that poem. Like the waters of the Tarim we began in this place and we will finish here We came from nowhere else and we will not leave for anywhere . . .

    In the months after my arrival in the United States, I was gripped by conflicting feelings of excitement and uncertainty, joy and pressure, anger and hope. My heart knew little peace. This was doubtless why I rarely found myself able to write poetry. Even in quiet moments, the verses wouldn’t come. Instead, I would remember Munire sobbing, or Perhat hurrying off into the dark. Often, I would see in my mind’s eye the torment of my dear ones. My cousin, weak and emaciated in his cell; Eli stooped over in an interrogation chamber; Almas undergoing political reeducation; Arman, forced to labor in a cotton mill; Ismail with a group of prisoners in the camp yard, shouting red songs of praise for the party in Chinese. One autumn night a couple of months after our arrival, I had another dream. I had died. I lay on my right side, unable to move, while five or six of my closest friends stood around me. They looked on in lamentation, hands clasped, white mourning shrouds around their waists. Sorrow and regret were written across their faces. I tried to cry out, “I’m not dead, I’m safe and sound in America,” but I couldn’t speak. I tried to move my limbs to show them I was alive, but my legs and arms wouldn’t budge. I was terrified they would bury me alive.

    Having escaped the terror, we are a fortunate family. Yet while we know the joy of those lucky few who boarded Noah’s ark, we live with the coward’s shame hidden in that word “escape.” We are finally free, but those we love most are suffering still, left behind in that tortured land. Each time we think of them, we burn with guilt. We will see these dear ones only in our dreams.
